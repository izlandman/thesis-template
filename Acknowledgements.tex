This book could not have been written without Dr. Xiaojiang Du, who
encouraged and challenged me through my academic program. He never
accepted less than my best efforts. Thank you. What is written in
this book are materials that I found in my papers. A
special thanks to the authors mentioned in the bibliography page. I
would like to acknowledge and extend my heartfelt gratitude to another advisor
of mine --Dr. Shan Lin. Most especially to my family,
friends and my son, Peiheng Ni. Words alone cannot express what I
owe them for their encouragement and whose patient love enabled me
to complete this book. A special thanks to Jie Wu for comments on my
editing. The book was developed from ideas originally published in the Globecom 2010, Infocom 2011 and %\cite{hanselman}.
As always it was editor Xuemin (Sherman) Shen who provided the shelter conditions under which the work could take place: thanks to him
for this and many other things.
