abstract = {This study presents the first detailed study of total variability modelling (TVM) for face verification. TVM was originally proposed for speaker verification, where it has been accepted as state-of-the-art technology. Also referred to as front-end factor analysis, TVM uses a probabilistic model to represent a speech recording as a low-dimensional vector known as an 'i-vector'. This representation has been successfully applied to a wide variety of speech-related pattern recognition applications, and remains a hot topic in biometrics. In this work, the authors extend the application of i-vectors beyond the domain of speech to a novel representation of facial images for the purpose of face verification. Extensive experimentation on several challenging and publicly available face recognition databases demonstrates that TVM generalises well to this modality, providing between 17 and 39{\%} relative reduction in verification error rate compared to a baseline Gaussian mixture model system. Several i-vector session compensation and scoring techniques were evaluated including source-normalised linear discriminant analysis (SN-LDA), probabilistic LDA and within-class covariance normalisation. Finally, this study provides a detailed comparison of the complexity of TVM, highlighting some important computational advantages with respect to related state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {Objective: Recent studies indicate that pathologic high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are signatures of epileptogenic brain. Automated tools are required to characterize these events. We present a new algorithm tuned to detect HFOs from 30 to 85 Hz, and validate it against human expert electroencephalographers. Methods: We randomly selected 28 3-min single-channel epochs of intracranial EEG (IEEG) from two patients. Three human reviewers and three automated detectors marked all records to identify candidate HFOs. Subsequently, human reviewers verified all markings. Results: A total of 1330 events were collectively identified. The new method presented here achieved 89.7{\%} accuracy against a consensus set of human expert markings. A one-way ANOVA determined no difference between the mean F-measures of the human reviewers and automated algorithm. Human ?? statistics (mean ?? = 0.38) demonstrated marginal identification consistency, primarily due to false negative errors. Conclusions: We present an HFO detector that improves upon existing algorithms, and performs as well as human experts on our test data set. Validation of detector performance must be compared to more than one expert because of interrater variability. Significance: This algorithm will be useful for analyzing large EEG databases to determine the pathophysiological significance of HFO events in human epileptic networks. ?? 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {We are happy to announce the release of the MSR Identity Toolbox: A MATLAB toolbox for speaker-recognition research. This toolbox contains a collection of MATLAB tools and routines that can be used for research and development in speaker recognition. It provides researchers with a test bed for developing new front-end and back-end techniques, allowing replicable evaluation of new advancements. It will also help newcomers in the field by lowering the "barrier to entry," enabling them to quickly build baseline systems for their experiments. Although the focus of this toolbox is on speaker recognition, it can also be used for other speech related applications such as language, dialect, and accent identification. Additionally, it provides many of the functionalities available in other open-source speaker recognition toolkits (e.g., ALIZE [1]) but with a simpler design which makes it easier for the users to understand and modify the algorithms.},

@article{Loo2012,
abstract = {Psychiatric research applications of electroencephalography (EEG), the earliest approach to imaging human cortical brain activity, are attracting increasing scientific and clinical interest. For more than 40 years, EEG research has attempted to characterize and quantify the neurophysiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), most consistently associating it with increased frontocentral theta band activity and increased theta to beta ($\theta$/$\beta$) power ratio during rest compared to non-ADHD controls. Recent reports suggest that while these EEG measures demonstrate strong discriminant validity for ADHD, significant EEG heterogeneity also exists across ADHD-diagnosed individuals. In particular, additional studies validating the use of the $\theta$/$\beta$ power ratio measure appear to be needed before it can be used for clinical diagnosis. In recent years, the number and the scientific quality of research reports on EEG-based neurofeedback (NF) for ADHD have grown considerably, although the studies reviewed here do not yet support NF training as a first-line, stand-alone treatment modality. In particular, more research is needed comparing NF to placebo control and other effective treatments for ADHD. Currently, after a long period of relative stasis, the neurophysiological specificity of measures used in EEG research is rapidly increasing. It is likely, therefore, that new EEG studies of ADHD using higher density recordings and new measures drawn from viewing EEG as a 3-dimensional functional imaging modality, as well as intensive re-analyses of existing EEG study data, can better characterize the neurophysiological differences between and within ADHD and non-ADHD subjects, and lead to more precise diagnostic measures and effective NF approaches.},

abstract = {Objective: This article reviews the electroencephalography (EEG) literature in relation to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD). Methods: The review briefly outlines the history of the disorder, focusing on the changing diagnostic systems which both reflect and constrain research into AD/HD. Both qualitative and quantitative EEG studies are examined, and their results are discussed in relation to various models of AD/HD. Implications of these data for future research and development in AD/HD are considered. Results: In terms of resting EEG, elevated relative theta power, and reduced relative alpha and beta, together with elevated theta/alpha and theta/beta ratios, are most reliably associated with AD/HD. Theta/alpha and theta/beta ratios also discriminate diagnostic subgroups of AD/HD. Recent studies of EEG heterogeneity in this disorder indicate the existence of different profiles of cortical anomalies which may cut across diagnostic types. Conclusions: The research to date has identified a substantial number of EEG correlates of AD/HD which hold promise for improving our understanding of the brain dysfunction(s) underlying the disorder. Further work in this field may benefit from a broader conceptual approach, integrating EEG and other measures of brain function. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

One technique for numerically classifying waveforms assesses their fractal dimensionality, D. For waveforms: D = log(n) (log(n) + log( d L)), with n = number of steps in the waveform (one less than the number of (x, y) point pairs), d = planar extent (diameter) of the waveform, and L = total length of the waveform. Under this formulation, fractal dimensions range from D = 1.0, for strainght lines through approximately D = 1.15 for random-walk waveforms, to D approaching 1.5 for the most convoluted waveforms. The fractal characterization may be especially useful for analyzing and comparing complex waveforms such as electroencephalograms (EEGs). {\textcopyright} 1988.},

The MPE/MWE criteria are smoothed approximations to the phone or word error rate respectively. We also discuss I-smoothing which is a novel technique for smoothing discriminative training criteria using statistics for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Experiments have been performed on the Switchboard/Call Home corpora of telephone conversations with up to 265 hours of training data. It is shown that for the maximum mutual information estimation (MMIE) criterion, I-smoothing reduces the word error rate (WER) by 0.4{\%} absolute over the MMIE baseline. The combination of MPE and I-smoothing gives an improvement of 1{\%} over MMIE and a total reduction in WER of 4.8{\%} absolute over the original MLE system.},

In the real word, this conditioning is not feasible. Our main purpose in this work is to propose a mixture of Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis models (PLDA) as a solution for making systems independent of speaker gender. In order to show the effectiveness of the mixture model, we first experiment on 2010 NIST telephone speech (det5), where we prove that there is no loss of accuracy compared with a baseline gender-dependent model. We also test with success the mixture model on a more realistic situation where there are cross-gender trials. Furthermore, we report results on microphone speech for the det1, det2, det3 and det4 tasks to confirm the effectiveness of the mixture model. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 ISCA.},

@article{Huang1998,
abstract = {A new method for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been devel- oped. The key part of the method is the ‘empirical mode decomposition' method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of ‘intrinsic mode functions' that admit well-behaved Hilbert trans- forms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the ‘instrinic mode functions' yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy–frequency–time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of ‘intrinsic mode functions' based on local properties of the signal, which makes the instanta- neous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to rep- resent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system data are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the nonlinear and non-stationary effects in the energy–frequency–time distribution.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of the EEG principles by Berger in the 20's, procedures for artifact removal have been essential in its pre-processing. In literature, diverse approaches based on signal processing, data mining, statistic models, and others compile information from multiple electrodes to build filters for artifact removal in the time, frequency or space domains. For almost one century, EEG acquisitions have required strict experimental conditions that included an isolated room, clinical acquisition systems, rigorous experimental protocols and very precise stimulation control. Under these steady experimental conditions, artifact removal techniques have not significantly evolved since then. However, in the last decade technological advances in brain-computer interfaces permit EEG acquisition by means of wireless, mobile, dry, wearable, and low-cost EEG headsets, with new potential daily-life applications, such as in entertainment or industry. New aspects not considered before, such as massive muscular and electrical artifacts, reduced number of electrodes, uncontrolled concomitant stimulus or the need for online processing are now essential. In this paper, we present a critical review of EEG artifact removal approaches, discuss their applicability to daily-life EEG-BCI applications, and give some directions and guidelines for upcoming research in this topic. Based on the results of the review, existing artifact removal techniques need further evolution to be applied in daily-life EEG-BCI. The use of multiple-step procedures is recommended, combining source decomposition with blind source separation and adaptive filtering, rather than using them separately. It is also recommendable to define and characterize most of artifacts evoked in daily-life EEG-BCI for a more effective removal.},

As well as covering the full story of this field (from 1980 to 2013), an overview of the findings made in genetic and neurophysiology areas, from which it is based, is also provided. After a comprehensive search, 109 biometric publications were found and studied, from which 88 were finally included in this document. A categorization of papers is proposed based on the recording paradigm. The most used databases, some of them public, have been identified and named to allow the comparison of results from these and future works. The findings of this work show that, although basic questions remain to be answered, the EEG, and specially its power spectrum in the range of the alpha rhythm, contains subject specific information that can be used for classification. Moreover, approaches such as a multi-day-session training, the fusion of information from different electrodes and bands, and Support Vector Machines are recommended to maximize the system's performance. All in all, the problem of subject identification by means of their EEG is harder than initially expected, as it relies on information extracted from complex heterogeneous EEG traits which are the results of elaborated models of inheritance, which in turn makes the problem very sensitive to its variables (time, frequency, space, recording paradigm and algorithms). ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the functional connectivity of different EEG bands at the "baseline" situation (rest) and during mathematical thinking in children and young adults to study the maturation effect on brain networks at rest and during a cognitive task. METHODS Twenty children (8-12 years) and twenty students (21-26 years) were studied. The synchronization likelihood was used to evaluate the interregional synchronization of different EEG frequency bands in children and adults, at rest and during math. Then, graphs were constructed and characterized in terms of local structure (clustering coefficient) and overall integration (path length) and the "optimal" organization of the connectivity i.e., the small world network (SWN). RESULTS The main findings were: (i) Enhanced synchronization for theta band during math more prominent in adults. (ii) Decrease of the optimal SWN organization of the alpha2 band during math. (iii) The beta and especially gamma bands showed lower synchronization and signs of lower SWN organization in both situations in adults. CONCLUSION There are interesting findings related to the two age groups and the two situations. The theta band showed higher synchronization during math in adults as a result of higher capacity of the working memory in this age group. The alpha2 band showed some SWN disorganization during math, a process analog to the known desynchronization. In adults, a dramatic reduction of the connections in gray matter occurs. Although this maturation process is probably related to higher efficiency, reduced connectivity is expressed by lower synchronization and lower mean values of the graph parameters in adults.},

abstract = {Most current speech recognition systems use hidden Markov models (HMMs) to deal with the temporal variability of speech and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to determine how well each state of each HMM fits a frame or a short window of frames of coefficients that represents the acoustic input. An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin. This article provides an overview of this progress and represents the shared views of four research groups that have had recent successes in using DNNs for acoustic modeling in speech recognition.},

abstract = {In modern face recognition, the conventional pipeline consists of four stages: detect ={\textgreater} align ={\textgreater} represent ={\textgreater} classify. We revisit both the alignment step and the representation step by employing explicit 3D face modeling in order to apply a piecewise affine transformation, and derive a face representation from a nine-layer deep neural network. This deep network involves more than 120 million parameters using several locally connected layers without weight sharing, rather than the standard convolutional layers. Thus we trained it on the largest facial dataset to-date, an identity labeled dataset of four million facial images belonging to more than 4,000 identities. The learned representations coupling the accurate model-based alignment with the large facial database generalize remarkably well to faces in unconstrained environments, even with a simple classifier. Our method reaches an accuracy of 97.35{\%} on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, reducing the error of the current state of the art by more than 27{\%}, closely approaching human-level performance.},

abstract = {Despite significant recent advances in the field of face recognition, implementing face verification and recognition efficiently at scale presents serious challenges to current approaches. In this paper we present a system, called FaceNet, that directly learns a mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure of face similarity. Once this space has been produced, tasks such as face recognition, verification and clustering can be easily implemented using standard techniques with FaceNet embeddings as feature vectors. Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches. To train, we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method. The benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency: we achieve state-of-the-art face recognition performance using only 128-bytes per face. On the widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, our system achieves a new record accuracy of 99.63{\%}. On YouTube Faces DB it achieves 95.12{\%}. Our system cuts the error rate in comparison to the best published result by 30{\%} on both datasets. We also introduce the concept of harmonic embeddings, and a harmonic triplet loss, which describe different versions of face embeddings (produced by different networks) that are compatible to each other and allow for direct comparison between each other.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Epilepsy is the second most common disease of the brain. Epilepsy makes it difficult for patients to live a normal life because it is difficult to predict when seizures will occur. In this regard, if seizures could be predicted a reasonable period of time before their occurrence, epilepsy patients could take precautions against them and improve their safety and quality of life. In this paper, we investigate a novel seizure precursor based on attractor state analysis for seizure prediction. METHODS We analyze the transition process from normal to seizure attractor state and investigate a precursor phenomenon seen before reaching the seizure attractor state. From the result of an analysis, we define a quantified spectral measure in scalp EEG for seizure prediction. From scalp EEG recordings, the Fourier coefficients of six EEG frequency bands are extracted, and the defined spectral measure is computed based on the coefficients for each half-overlapped 20-second-long window. The computed spectral measure is applied to seizure prediction using a low-complexity methodology. RESULTS Within scalp EEG, we identified an early-warning indicator before an epileptic seizure occurs. Getting closer to the bifurcation point that triggers the transition from normal to seizure state, the power spectral density of low frequency bands of the perturbation of an attractor in the EEG, showed a relative increase. A low-complexity seizure prediction algorithm using this feature was evaluated, using ∼583h of scalp EEG in which 143 seizures in 16 patients were recorded. With the test dataset, the proposed method showed high sensitivity (86.67{\%}) with a false prediction rate of 0.367h(-1) and average prediction time of 45.3min. CONCLUSIONS A novel seizure prediction method using scalp EEG, based on attractor state analysis, shows potential for application with real epilepsy patients. This is the first study in which the seizure-precursor phenomenon of an epileptic seizure is investigated based on attractor-based analysis of the macroscopic dynamics of the brain. With the scalp EEG, we first propose use of a spectral feature identified for seizure prediction, in which the dynamics of an attractor are excluded, and only the perturbation dynamics from the attractor are considered.},

abstract = {A method of automatic adaptive segmentation of EEGs, whereby the boundaries between different patterns of activity appearing in a given channel are identified and demarcated, has been applied to a group of clinical EEGs. The EEGs were especially selected from a library of 70 recordings so as to include a diversity of normal and abnormal EEG patterns. In the subsequent steps of the analysis, like segments were automatically clustered and a dendrogram plotted, from which the principal clusters or types of activity were visually selected. For the latter, a temporal profile was then plotted, indicating which type of activity was present at any given time during the respective recording. Summary parameters of mean amplitude and a measure of mean frequency were plotted alongside the temporal profile. The findings are as follows. (1) A single set of segmentation parameters was found to be clinically satisfactory for the entire group. (2) The inappropriateness of adaptive segmentation for the isolation of spikes and sharp waves, which had been anticipated in view of the short duration of such transients in relation to the length of the window (1.2 sec) used for the autocorrelation functions employed in the segmentation algorithm, was confirmed. A separate spike/sharp-wave detection algorithm is therefore planned. (3) Longer transients (i.e., some 300 msec or greater) are segmented and separately clustered. (4) For an individual EEG, the number of clinically significant clusters was 5 or less. (5) If a given cluster included activity in more than one frequency band (for example, simultaneous alpha and slow activity) the simple summary parameters of mean amplitude and a measure of mean frequency may not be sufficient for a clinically adequate description; however, the original autocorrelation function, or, more conventionally, the power spectrum (which can be estimated from the autocorrelation function) provides the necessary information. (6) The use of automatic adaptive EEG segmentation minimized human bias in the selection of portions of EEG recordings for computer analysis. ?? 1981.},

abstract = {Space-oriented segmentation can decompose multi-channel EEG map series into time segments characterized by quasi-stationary field map configurations. This assesses the dynamics of the underlying processes as activities of different neural generator ensembles. Our method of space-oriented segmentation describes the scalp field at times of maximal field strength (Global Field Power) by the locations of the centroids of positive and negative map areas. A quantitative measure of the simultaneous distance of the centroid locations evaluates the similarity between consecutive maps. A segment is defined as a sequence of maps that do not differ from each other by more than a preset value. Finally, the average centroid locations for each segment are entered into an agglomerative clustering procedure to obtain a set of distinct classes of field configurations. Four records of 16 s of 42-channel resting EEG (band-pass filtered 2-16 Hz) from six subjects were analyzed. Average segment duration was 157.9 ms. Most segments belonged to a small number of classes (from 2 to 6, mean 3.7 classes for 90{\%} of analysis time). The most frequent class showed an anterior-posterior field orientation and covered from 45 to 74{\%} (mean 55{\%} across subjects) of total time, with an average duration of 265 ms. The procedure was also tested using temporally and spatially unstructured data (white noise and randomly shuffled EEG) to ascertain that the methods reflect the spatio-temporal structure of the EEG processes. ?? 1993.},

However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in human survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to test whether circulating IGF-1 axis parameters associate with old age survival and functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study. This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 – 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was assessed by (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scales. Compared to those in the quartile with the highest IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, nonagenarians in the lowest quartile had higher scores for ADL (ptrend=0.001) and IADL (ptrend=0.003). These findings suggest that IGF-1 axis parameters are associated with increased old age survival and better functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study.},

It aims to improve the classification performance when the training set of the target subject (namely user) is small owing to the need to reduce the calibration session. Our framework pursues improvement not only at the feature extraction stage, but also at the classification stage. At the feature extraction stage, we first obtain a candidate filter set for each subject through a previously proposed feature extraction method. Then, we design different criterions to learn two sparse subsets of the candidate filter set, which are called the robust filter bank and adaptive filter bank, respectively. Given robust and adaptive filter banks, at the classification step, we learn classifiers corresponding to these filter banks and employ a two-level ensemble strategy to dynamically and locally combine their outcomes to reach a single decision output. The proposed framework, as validated by experimental results, can achieve positive knowledge transfer for improving the performance of EEG classification. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Purpose: The goal of the project is to determine characteristics of academic neurophysiologist EEG interpreters (EEGers), which predict good interrater agreement (IRA) and to determine the number of EEGers needed to develop an ideal standardized testing and training data set for epileptiform transient (ET) detection algorithms.Methods: A three-phase scoring method was used. In phase 1, 19 EEGers marked the location of ETs in two hundred 30-second segments of EEG from 200 different patients. In phase 2, EEG events marked by at least 2 EEGers were annotated by 18 EEGers on a 5-point scale to indicate whether they were ETs. In phase 3, a third opinion was obtained from EEGers on any inconsistencies between phase 1 and phase 2 scoring.Results: The IRA for the 18 EEGers was only fair. A select group of the EEGers had good IRA and the other EEGers had low IRA. Board certification by the American Board of Clinical Neurophysiology was associated with better IRA performance but other board certifications, years of fellowship training, and years of practice were not. As the number of EEGers used for scoring is increased, the amount of change in the consensus opinion decreases steadily and is quite low as the group size approaches 10.Conclusions: The IRA among EEGers varies considerably. The EEGers must be tested before use as scorers for ET annotation research projects. The American Board of Clinical Neurophysiology certification is associated with improved performance. The optimal size for a group of experts scoring ETs in EEG is probably in the 6 to 10 range.},

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8× deeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complex- ity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our ex- tremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative im- provement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet local- ization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) has, historically, played a focal role in the assessment of neural function in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We review here the most recent developments in the utility of EEG in the diagnosis of ADHD, with emphasis on the most commonly used and emerging EEG metrics and their reliability in diagnostic classification. Considering the clinical heterogeneity of ADHD and the complexity of information available from the EEG signals, we suggest that considerable benefits are to be gained from multivariate analyses and a focus towards understanding of the neural generators of EEG. We conclude that while EEG cannot currently be used as a diagnostic tool, vast developments in analytical and technological tools in its domain anticipate future progress in its utility in the clinical setting.},

abstract = {Objectives: The spatial aspects of brain electrical activity can be assessed by equivalent EEG frequency band generators. We aimed to describe alterations of these EEG generators in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy aging and whether they could serve as predictive markers of AD in subjects at risk. Methods: The amplitude and 3-dimensional localization of equivalent EEG sources were evaluated using FFT dipole approximation in 38 mild AD patients, 31 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 24 healthy control subjects. Results: AD patients showed an increase of delta and theta global field power (GFP), which corresponds to the generalized EEG amplitude, as well as a reduction of alpha GFP when compared to the controls. A decrease of alpha and beta GFP was found in AD patients, as compared to the MCI subjects. With respect to topography in the antero-posterior direction, sources of alpha and beta activity shifted more anteriorly in AD patients compared to both the controls and MCI subjects. No significant difference was found between MCI and controls. Combined alpha and theta GFP were the best discriminating variables between AD patients and controls (84{\%} correct classification) and AD and MCI subjects (78{\%} correctly classified). MCI subjects were followed longitudinally (25 months on average) in order to compare differences in baseline EEG variables between MCI subjects who progressed to AD (PMCI) and those who remained stable (SMCI). Compared to SMCI, PMCI had decreased alpha GFP and a more anterior localization of sources of theta, alpha and beta frequency. In a linear discriminant analysis applied on baseline values of the two MCI subgroups, the best predictor of future development of AD was found to be antero-posterior localization of alpha frequency. Conclusions: FFT dipole approximation and frequency analysis performed by conventional FFT showed comparable classification accuracy between the studied groups. We conclude that localization and amplitude of equivalent EEG sources could be promising markers of early AD.},

abstract = {Epilepsy patients who do not respond to pharmacological treatments currently have only brain surgery as a major alternative therapy. Identifying which brain areas to remove is thus of critical importance for physicians and the patient. Currently, this process is almost entirely manual, can vary greatly between clinical experts and centers, and depends only on qualitative EEG features, all of which may help explain the only modest success of extratemperal lobe epilepsy surgery. In this study, we explore an unsupervised, quantitative method for identifying seizure onset regions. A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) was used to cluster 500 ms epochs of intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) prior to (preictal) and during (ictal) seizures in week-long continuous recordings from three patients during evalulation for epilepsy surgery. The GMM learning paradigm determines the optimal number of clusters for each patient. For the two patients whose epochs sorted into two clusters, we found that one cluster was predominantly composed of seizure epochs, and a subset of the channels made brief "forays" into that cluser in the time leading up to seizure onset. This observation is in keeping with the clinical hypothesis that certain brain areas may be the initiators of seizure activity, and we find that the channels independently labeled by physicians as seizure onset zones (SOZs) are statistically overrepesented in the seizure-defined cluster. Nevertheless, we also find that a subset of channels not labeled as SOZs has similar properties as those labeled SOZs. In this study we have tried to avoid many of the assumptions commonly made about what features and events are indicative of epileptogenic activity and believe that such analysis can help avoid many of the pitfalls of manual, non-objective human SOZ marking.},

abstract = {A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that allows its users to control external devices with brain activity. Although the proof-of-concept was given decades ago, the reliable translation of user intent into device control commands is still a major challenge. Success requires the effective interaction of two adaptive controllers: the user's brain, which produces brain activity that encodes intent, and the BCI system, which translates that activity into device control commands. In order to facilitate this interaction, many laboratories are exploring a variety of signal analysis techniques to improve the adaptation of the BCI system to the user. In the literature, many machine learning and pattern classification algorithms have been reported to give impressive results when applied to BCI data in offline analyses. However, it is more difficult to evaluate their relative value for actual online use. BCI data competitions have been organized to provide objective formal evaluations of alternative methods. Prompted by the great interest in the first two BCI Competitions, we organized the third BCI Competition to address several of the most difficult and important analysis problems in BCI research. The paper describes the data sets that were provided to the competitors and gives an overview of the results.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based speaker recognition/verification systems utilize a universal background model (UBM), which typically requires extensive resources, especially if multiple channel and microphone categories are considered. In this study, a systematic analysis of speaker verification system performance is considered for which the UBM data is selected and purposefully altered in different ways, including variation in the amount of data, sub-sampling structure of the feature frames, and variation in the number of speakers. An objective measure is formulated from the UBM covariance matrix which is found to be highly correlated with system performance when the data amount was varied while keeping the UBM data set constant, and increasing the number of UBM speakers while keeping the data amount constant. The advantages of feature sub-sampling for improving UBM training speed is also discussed, and a novel and effective phonetic distance-based frame selection method is developed. The sub-sampling methods presented are shown to retain baseline equal error rate (EER) system performance using only 1{\%} of the original UBM data, resulting in a drastic reduction in UBM training computation time. This, in theory, dispels the myth of {\&}{\#}x201C;There's no data like more data{\&}{\#}x201D; for the purpose of UBM construction. With respect to the UBM speakers, the effect of systematically controlling the number of training (UBM) speakers versus overall system performance is analyzed. It is shown experimentally that increasing the inter-speaker variability in the UBM data while maintaining the overall total data size constant gradually improves system performance. Finally, two alternative speaker selection methods based on different speaker diversity measures are presented. Using the proposed schemes, it is shown that by selecting a diverse set of UBM speakers, the baseline system performance can be retained using less than 30{\%} of the original UBM speakers.},

This work aims to fill this gap, and in particular, it focuses on the time-frequency representation of the EEG.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAPPROACH: We executed qualitative and quantitative analyses of six publicly available data sets following a sequential experimentation approach. This approach was divided in three blocks analysing the configuration of the power spectrum density, the representation of the data and the properties of the discriminant information. A total of ten experiments were applied.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN RESULTS: Results show that EEG information below 40 Hz is unique enough to discriminate across subjects (a maximum of 100 subjects were evaluated here), regardless of the recorded cognitive task or the sensor location. Moreover, the discriminative power of rhythms follows a W-like shape between 1 and 40 Hz, with the central peak located at the posterior rhythm (around 10 Hz). This information is maximized with segments of around 2 s, and it proved to be moderately constant across montages and time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSIGNIFICANCE: Therefore, we characterize how EEG activity differs across individuals and detail the optimal conditions to detect subject-specific information. This work helps to clarify the results of previous studies and to solve some unanswered questions. Ultimately, it will serve as guide for the design of future biometric systems.},

abstract = {We aimed to examine whether commonly observed individual differences in sleep architecture and the sleep electroencephalogram reflect individual traits, which are amenable to a genetic investigation of human sleep. We studied intra-individual stability and inter-individual variation in sleep and sleep electroencephalogram spectra across four baseline recordings of eight healthy young men. A similarity concept based on Euclidean distances between vectors was applied. Visually scored sleep variables served as feature vector components, along with electroencephalogram power spectra in non-rapid-eye-movement and rapid-eye-movement sleep. The distributions of similarity coefficients of feature vectors revealed a clear distinction between high within-subject similarity (i.e. stability), and low between-subject similarity (i.e. variation). Moreover, a cluster analysis based on electroencephalogram spectra in both non-rapid-eye-movement and rapid-eye-movement sleep segregated all four baseline nights of each individual into a distinct cluster. To investigate whether high and low sleep pressure affects the similarity coefficients, normalized non-rapid-eye-movement sleep electroencephalogram spectra of the first and second half of the recordings were compared. Because the electroencephalogram changes systematically in the course of the night, within-subject variation no longer differed from between-subject variation. In conclusion, our data provide evidence for trait-like characteristics in the sleep electroencephalogram. Further studies may help to identify distinct phenotypes to search for genes underlying functional aspects of undisturbed human sleep.},

The studies on delta (0.5–3.5 Hz) oscillatory responses in humans upon application of cognitive paradigms showed that delta oscillations are related to cognitive processes, mainly in decision making and attentional processes. The present manuscript comprehensively reviews the studies on delta oscillatory responses upon cognitive stimulation in healthy subjects and in different pathologies, namely Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and alcoholism. Further delta oscillatory response upon presentation of faces, facial expressions, and affective pictures are reviewed. The relationship between pre-stimulus delta activity and post-stimulus evoked and event-related responses and/or oscillations is discussed. Cross-frequency couplings of delta oscillations with higher frequency windows are also included in the review. The conclusion of this review includes several important remarks, including that delta oscillatory responses are involved in cognitive and emotional processes. A decrease of delta oscillatory responses could be a general electrophysiological marker for cognitive dysfunction (Alzheimer's disease, MCI, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and alcoholism).

abstract = {Aging induces multiple changes to sleep spindles, which may hinder their alleged functional role in memory and sleep protection mechanisms. Brain aging in specific cortical regions could affect the neural networks underlying spindle generation, yet the topography of these age-related changes is currently unknown. In the present study, we analyzed spindle characteristics in 114 healthy volunteers aged between 20 and 73 years over 5 anteroposterior electroencephalography scalp derivations. Spindle density, amplitude, and duration were higher in young subjects than in middle-aged and elderly subjects in all derivations, but the topography of age effects differed drastically. Age-related decline in density and amplitude was more prominent in anterior derivations, whereas duration showed a posterior prominence. Age groups did not differ in all-night spindle frequency for any derivation. These results show that age-related changes in sleep spindles follow distinct topographical patterns that are specific to each spindle characteristic. This topographical specificity may provide a useful biomarker to localize age-sensitive changes in underlying neural systems during normal and pathological aging. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {With the advent of multi-channel EEG hardware systems and the concurrent development of topographic and tomographic signal source localization methods, the international 10/20 system, a standard system for electrode positioning with 21 electrodes, was extended to higher density electrode settings such as 10/10 and 10/5 systems, allowing more than 300 electrode positions. However, their effectiveness as relative head-surface-based positioning systems has not been examined. We previously developed a virtual 10/20 measurement algorithm that can analyze any structural MR head and brain image. Extending this method to the virtual 10/10 and 10/5 measurement algorithms, we analyzed the MR images of 17 healthy subjects. The acquired scalp positions of the 10/10 and 10/5 systems were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) stereotactic coordinates and their spatial variability was assessed. We described and examined the effects of spatial variability due to the selection of positioning systems and landmark placement strategies. As long as a detailed rule for a particular system was provided, it yielded precise landmark positions on the scalp. Moreover, we evaluated the effective spatial resolution of 329 scalp landmark positions of the 10/5 system for multi-subject studies. As long as a detailed rule for landmark setting was provided, 241 scalp positions could be set effectively when there was no overlapping of two neighboring positions. Importantly, 10/10 positions could be well separated on a scalp without overlapping. This study presents a referential framework for establishing the effective spatial resolutions of 10/20, 10/10, and 10/5 systems as relative head-surface-based positioning systems.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development and testing of a system whereby one can communicate through a computer by using the P300 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP). Such a system may be used as a communication aid by individuals who cannot use any motor system for communication (e.g., 'locked-in' patients). The 26 letters of the alphabet, together with several other symbols and commands, are displayed on a computer screen which serves as the keyboard or prosthetic device. The subject focuses attention successively on the characters he wishes to communicate. The computer detects the chosen character on-line and in real time. This detection is achieved by repeatedly flashing rows and columns of the matrix. When the elements containing the chosen character are flashed, a P300 is elicited, and it is this P300 that is detected by the computer. We report an analysis of the operating characteristics of the system when used with normal volunteers, who took part in 2 experimental sessions. In the first session (the pilot study/training session) subjects attempted to spell a word and convey it to a voice synthesizer for production. In the second session (the analysis of the operating characteristics of the system) subjects were required simply to attend to individual letters of a word for a specific number of trials while data were recorded for off-line analysis. The analyses suggest that this communication channel can be operated accurately at the rate of 0.20 bits/sec. In other words, under the conditions we used, subjects can communicate 12.0 bits, or 2.3 characters, per min. ?? 1988.},

The method can be used for recognition or verification applications where the number of categories is very large and not known during training, and where the number of training samples for a single category is very small. The idea is to learn a function that maps input patterns into a target space such that the L1 norm in the target space approximates the "semantic" distance in the input space. The method is applied to a face verification task. The learning process minimizes a discriminative loss function that drives the similarity metric to be small for pairs of faces from the same person, and large for pairs from different persons. The mapping from raw to the target space is a convolutional network whose architecture is designed for robustness to geometric distortions. The system is tested on the Purdue/AR face database which has a very high degree of variability in the pose, lighting, expression, position, and artificial occlusions such as dark glasses and obscuring scarves.},

A double-loop Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm has been introduced to the ME network structure for detection of epileptic seizure. The detection of epileptiform discharges in the EEG is an important component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. EEG signals were decomposed into the frequency sub-bands using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Then these sub-band frequencies were used as an input to a ME network with two discrete outputs: normal and epileptic. In order to improve accuracy, the outputs of expert networks were combined according to a set of local weights called the "gating function". The invariant transformations of the ME probability density functions include the permutations of the expert labels and the translations of the parameters in the gating functions. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated in terms of classification accuracies and the results confirmed that the proposed ME network structure has some potential in detecting epileptic seizures. The ME network structure achieved accuracy rates which were higher than that of the stand-alone neural network model. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {On-line learning and recognition of spatio- and spectro-temporal data (SSTD) is a very challenging task and an important one for the future development of autonomous machine learning systems with broad applications. Models based on spiking neural networks (SNN) have already proved their potential in capturing spatial and temporal data. One class of them, the evolving SNN (eSNN), uses a one-pass rank-order learning mechanism and a strategy to evolve a new spiking neuron and new connections to learn new patterns from incoming data. So far these networks have been mainly used for fast image and speech frame-based recognition. Alternative spike-time learning methods, such as Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and its variant Spike Driven Synaptic Plasticity (SDSP), can also be used to learn spatio-temporal representations, but they usually require many iterations in an unsupervised or semi-supervised mode of learning. This paper introduces a new class of eSNN, dynamic eSNN, that utilise both rank-order learning and dynamic synapses to learn SSTD in a fast, on-line mode. The paper also introduces a new model called deSNN, that utilises rank-order learning and SDSP spike-time learning in unsupervised, supervised, or semi-supervised modes. The SDSP learning is used to evolve dynamically the network changing connection weights that capture spatio-temporal spike data clusters both during training and during recall. The new deSNN model is first illustrated on simple examples and then applied on two case study applications: (1) moving object recognition using address-event representation (AER) with data collected using a silicon retina device; (2) EEG SSTD recognition for brain-computer interfaces. The deSNN models resulted in a superior performance in terms of accuracy and speed when compared with other SNN models that use either rank-order or STDP learning. The reason is that the deSNN makes use of both the information contained in the order of the first input spikes (which information is explicitly present in input data streams and would be crucial to consider in some tasks) and of the information contained in the timing of the following spikes that is learned by the dynamic synapses as a whole spatio-temporal pattern. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A new approach to trace the dynamic patterns of task-based functional connectivity, by combining signal segmentation, dynamic time warping (DTW), and Quality Threshold (QT) clustering techniques, is presented. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals of 5 healthy subjects were recorded as they performed an auditory oddball and a visual modified oddball tasks. To capture the dynamic patterns of functional connectivity during the execution of each task, EEG signals are segmented into durations that correspond to the temporal windows of previously well-studied event-related potentials (ERPs). For each temporal window, DTW is employed to measure the functional similarities among channels. Unlike commonly used temporal similarity measures, such as cross correlation, DTW compares time series by taking into consideration that their alignment properties may vary in time. QT clustering analysis is then used to automatically identify the functionally connected regions in each temporal window. For each task, the proposed approach was able to establish a unique sequence of dynamic pattern (observed in all 5 subjects) for brain functional connectivity. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {Objective: This study investigated inter-rater agreement (IRA) among EEG experts for the identification of electrographic seizures and periodic discharges (PDs) in continuous ICU EEG recordings. Methods: Eight board-certified EEG experts independently identified seizures and PDs in thirty 1-h EEG segments which were selected from ICU EEG recordings collected from three medical centers. IRA was compared between seizure and PD identifications, as well as among rater groups that have passed an ICU EEG Certification Test, developed by the Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium (CCEMRC). Results: Both kappa and event-based IRA statistics showed higher mean values in identification of seizures compared to PDs (k= 0.58 vs. 0.38; p{\textless}. 0.001). The group of rater pairs who had both passed the ICU EEG Certification Test had a significantly higher mean IRA in comparison to rater pairs in which neither had passed the test. Conclusions: IRA among experts is significantly higher for identification of electrographic seizures compared to PDs. Additional instruction, such as the training module and certification test developed by the CCEMRC, could enhance this IRA. Significance: This study demonstrates more disagreement in the labeling of PDs in comparison to seizures. This may be improved by education about standard EEG nomenclature.},

@article{Roux2007,
abstract = {Deep Belief Networks (DBN) are generative neural network models with many layers of hidden explanatory factors, recently introduced by Hinton et al., along with a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm. The building block of a DBN is a probabilistic model called a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), used to represent one layer of the model. Restricted Boltzmann Machines are interesting because inference is easy in them, and because they have been successfully used as building blocks for training deeper models. We first prove that adding hidden units yields strictly improved modeling power, while a second theorem shows that RBMs are universal approximators of discrete distributions. We then study the question of whether DBNs with more layers are strictly more powerful in terms of representational power. This suggests a new and less greedy criterion for training RBMs within DBNs. 1},

abstract = {We investigate the potential of using electrical brainwave signals during imagined speech to identify which subject the signals originated from. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) from 6 volunteer subjects imagining speaking one of two syllables, /ba/ and /ku/, at different rhythms without performing any overt actions. In this work, we assess the degree of subject-to-subject variation and the feasibility of using imagined speech for subject identification. The EEG data are first preprocessed to reduce the effects of artifacts and noise, and autoregressive (AR) coefficients are extracted from each electrode's signal and concatenated for subject identification using a linear SVM classifier. The subjects were identifiable to a 99.76{\%} accuracy, which indicates a clear potential for using imagined speech EEG data for biome{\&}{\#}x0301;trie identification due to its strong inter-subject variation. Furthermore, the subject identification appears to be tolerant to differing conditions such as different imagined syllables and rhythms (as it is expected that the subjects will not imagine speaking the syllables at exactly the same rhythms from trial to trial). The proposed approach was also tested on a publicly available database consisting of EEG signals corresponding to Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) to test the applicability of the proposed method on a larger number of subjects, and it was able to classify 120 subjects with 98.96{\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) can affect individuals of any age, but is most common in younger adults (aged 20–45 years). Generalised tonic-clonic seizures are the greatest risk factor for SUDEP; most often, SUDEP occurs after this type of seizure in bed during sleep hours and the person is found in a prone position. SUDEP excludes other forms of seizure-related sudden death that might be mechanistically related (eg, death after single febrile, unprovoked seizures, or status epilepticus). Typically, postictal apnoea and bradycardia progress to asystole and death. A crucial element of SUDEP is brainstem dysfunction, for which postictal generalised EEG suppression might be a biomarker. Dysfunction in serotonin and adenosine signalling systems, as well as genetic disorders affecting cardiac conduction and neuronal excitability, might also contribute. Because generalised tonic-clonic seizures precede most cases of SUDEP, patients must be better educated about prevention. The value of nocturnal monitoring to detect seizures and postictal stimulation is unproven but warrants further study.},

abstract = {Quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) plays a significant role in EEG-based clinical diagnosis and studies of brain function. In past decades, various qEEG methods have been extensively studied. This article provides a detailed review of the advances in this field. qEEG methods are generally classified into linear and nonlinear approaches. The traditional qEEG approach is based on spectrum analysis, which hypothesizes that the EEG is a stationary process. EEG signals are nonstationary and nonlinear, especially in some pathological conditions. Various time-frequency representations and time-dependent measures have been proposed to address those transient and irregular events in EEG. With regard to the nonlinearity of EEG, higher order statistics and chaotic measures have been put forward. In characterizing the interactions across the cerebral cortex, an information theory-based measure such as mutual information is applied. To improve the spatial resolution, qEEG analysis has also been combined with medical imaging technology (e.g., CT, MR, and PET). With these advances, qEEG plays a very important role in basic research and clinical studies of brain injury, neurological disorders, epilepsy, sleep studies and consciousness, and brain function.},

abstract = {Objective The interpretation of critical care electroencephalography (EEG) studies is challenging because of the presence of many periodic and rhythmic patterns of uncertain clinical significance. Defining the clinical significance of these patterns requires standardized terminology with high interrater agreement (IRA). We sought to evaluate IRA for the final, published American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS)–approved version of the critical care EEG terminology (2012 version). Our evaluation included terms not assessed previously and incorporated raters with a broad range of EEG reading experience. Methods After reviewing a set of training slides, 49 readers independently completed a Web-based test consisting of 11 identical questions for each of 37 EEG samples (407 questions). Questions assessed whether a pattern was an electrographic seizure; pattern location (main term 1), pattern type (main term 2); and presence and classification of eight other key features (“plus” modifiers, sharpness, absolute and relative amplitude, frequency, number of phases, fluctuation/evolution, and the presence of “triphasic” morphology). Results IRA statistics ($\kappa$ values) were almost perfect (90–100{\%}) for seizures, main terms 1 and 2, the +S modifier (superimposed spikes/sharp waves or sharply contoured rhythmic delta activity), sharpness, absolute amplitude, frequency, and number of phases. Agreement was substantial for the +F (superimposed fast activity) and +R (superimposed rhythmic delta activity) modifiers (66{\%} and 67{\%}, respectively), moderate for triphasic morphology (58{\%}), and fair for evolution (21{\%}). Significance IRA for most terms in the ACNS critical care EEG terminology is high. These terms are suitable for multicenter research on the clinical significance of critical care EEG patterns.

abstract = {Brain activities commonly recorded using the electroencephalogram (EEG) are contaminated with ocular artifacts. These activities can be suppressed using a robust independent component analysis (ICA) tool, but its efficiency relies on manual intervention to accurately identify the independent artifactual components. In this paper, we present a new unsupervised, robust, and computationally fast statistical algorithm that uses modified multiscale sample entropy (mMSE) and Kurtosis to automatically identify the independent eye blink artifactual components, and subsequently denoise these components using biorthogonal wavelet decomposition. A 95{\%} two-sided confidence interval of the mean is used to determine the threshold for Kurtosis and mMSE to identify the blink related components in the ICA decomposed data. The algorithm preserves the persistent neural activity in the independent components and removes only the artifactual activity. Results have shown improved performance in the reconstructed EEG signals using the proposed unsupervised algorithm in terms of mutual information, correlation coefficient, and spectral coherence in comparison with conventional zeroing-ICA and wavelet enhanced ICA artifact removal techniques. The algorithm achieves an average sensitivity of 90{\%} and an average specificity of 98{\%}, with average execution time for the datasets ( N = 7) of 0.06 s ( SD = 0.021) compared to the conventional wICA requiring 0.1078 s ( SD = 0.004). The proposed algorithm neither requires manual identification for artifactual components nor additional electrooculographic channel. The algorithm was tested for 12 channels, but might be useful for dense EEG systems.},

abstract = {In the last three decades, much emphasis has been placed on neural oscillations in vitro, in vivo, as well as in the human brain. These brain oscillations have been studied extensively in the resting electroencephalogram (EEG), as well as in the underlying evoked oscillations that make up the event-related potentials (ERPs). There are several approaches to elucidate the possible mechanisms of these brain oscillations. One approach is to look at the neurophysiology and neurochemistry involved in generating and modulating these oscillations. Another more recent approach is to examine the genetic underpinnings of these neural oscillations. It is proposed that the genetic underpinnings of these oscillations are likely to stem from regulatory genes which control the neurochemical processes of the brain, and therefore influence neural function. Genetic analyses of human brain oscillations may identify genetic loci underlying the functional organization of human neuroelectric activity. Brain oscillations represent important correlates of human information processing and cognition. They represent highly heritable traits that are less complex and more proximal to gene function than either diagnostic labels or traditional cognitive measures. Therefore these oscillations may be utilized as phenotypes of cognition and as valuable tools for the understanding of some complex genetic disorders. Genetic loci that have been recently identified regarding both resting and evoked brain oscillations involving the GABAergic and cholinergic neurotransmitter systems of the brain are discussed. It is concluded that the advent of genomics and proteomics and a fuller understanding of gene regulation will open new horizons on the critical electrical events so essential for human brain function. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

EEG-based biometry is an emerging research topic and we believe that it may open new research directions and applications in the future. However, very little work has been done in this area and was focusing mainly on person identification but not on person authentication. Person authentication aims to accept or to reject a person claiming an identity, i.e., comparing a biometric data to one template, while the goal of person identification is to match the biometric data against all the records in a database. We propose the use of a statistical framework based on Gaussian Mixture Models and Maximum A Posteriori model adaptation, successfully applied to speaker and face authentication, which can deal with only one training session. We perform intensive experimental simulations using several strict train/test protocols to show the potential of our method. We also show that there are some mental tasks that are more appropriate for person authentication than others.},

abstract = {Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) allow a user to control a computer application by brain activity as acquired, e.g., by EEG. One of the biggest challenges in BCI research is to understand and solve the problem of "BCI Illiteracy", which is that BCI control does not work for a non-negligible portion of users (estimated 15 to 30{\%}). Here, we investigate the illiteracy problem in BCI systems which are based on the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms. In this paper, a sophisticated adaptation scheme is presented which guides the user from an initial subject-independent classifier that operates on simple features to a subject-optimized state-of-the-art classifier within one session while the user interacts the whole time with the same feedback application. While initial runs use supervised adaptation methods for robust co-adaptive learning of user and machine, final runs use unsupervised adaptation and therefore provide an unbiased measure of BCI performance. Using this approach, which does not involve any offline calibration measurement, good performance was obtained by good BCI participants (also one novice) after 3-6 min of adaptation. More importantly, the use of machine learning techniques allowed users who were unable to achieve successful feedback before to gain significant control over the BCI system. In particular, one participant had no peak of the sensory motor idle rhythm in the beginning of the experiment, but could develop such peak during the course of the session (and use voluntary modulation of its amplitude to control the feedback application).},

abstract = {In numerous neuroscience studies, multichannel EEG data are often recorded over multiple trial periods under the same experimental condition. To date, little effort is aimed to learn spatial patterns from EEG data to account for trial-to-trial variability. In this paper, a hierarchical Bayesian framework is introduced to model inter-trial source variability while extracting common spatial patterns under multiple experimental conditions in a supervised manner. We also present a variational Bayesian algorithm for model inference, by which the number of sources can be determined effectively via automatic relevance determination (ARD). The efficacy of the proposed learning algorithm is validated with both synthetic and real EEG data. Using two brain-computer interface (BCI) motor imagery data sets we show the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms the common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm while attaining comparable performance with a recently proposed discriminative approach.},

abstract = {This work presents a fine-grained analysis of the performance and limitations of the Microsoft Kinect sensor for tracking human movement in the context of biomechanical research and clinical applications. Earlier work in this field has focused on scalar summary measures or ad-hoc metrics with respect to specific movements that do not generalize well across clinical applications. In this work, the performance of the Microsoft Kinect is compared to motion tracking from a concurrently sampled professional grade Qualisys motion capture system. Subjects performed a range of clinically relevant tasks such as Sit-to-Stand and Timed Up-and-Go. Captured data included both three-dimensional joint center displacements and joint angles as recorded from both systems. Kinect performance was measured using cross correlation coefficients (CCR), root mean squared error (RMSE) relative to the Qualisys gold-standard and a new summary metric (SM) that combines both. Our results show that the Kinect-based system provides adequate performance when tracking joint center displacements in time, with overall CCR = 0.78, RMSE = 3.35 cm and SM = 1.21. On the contrary, lower accuracy was measured when tracking joint angles, with CCR = 0.58, RMSE = 24.59°, and SM = 3.76. Although performance differences for various movements and motion planes have been found, the results suggest that the Kinect is a viable tool for general biomechanical research, with specific limits on what levels of performance can be expected under various conditions.},

abstract = {Previously, modulations in power of neuronal oscillations have been functionally linked to sensory, motor and cognitive operations. Such links are commonly established by relating the power modulations to specific target variables such as reaction times or task ratings. Consequently, the resulting spatio-spectral representation is subjected to neurophysiological interpretation. As an alternative, independent component analysis (ICA) or alternative decomposition methods can be applied and the power of the components may be related to the target variable. In this paper we show that these standard approaches are suboptimal as the first does not take into account the superposition of many sources due to volume conduction, while the second is unable to exploit available information about the target variable. To improve upon these approaches we introduce a novel (supervised) source separation framework called Source Power Comodulation (SPoC). SPoC makes use of the target variable in the decomposition process in order to give preference to components whose power comodulates with the target variable. We present two algorithms that implement the SPoC approach. Using simulations with a realistic head model, we show that the SPoC algorithms are able extract neuronal components exhibiting high correlation of power with the target variable. In this task, the SPoC algorithms outperform other commonly used techniques that are based on the sensor data or ICA approaches. Furthermore, using real electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during an auditory steady state paradigm, we demonstrate the utility of the SPoC algorithms by extracting neuronal components exhibiting high correlation of power with the intensity of the auditory input. Taking into account the results of the simulations and real EEG recordings, we conclude that SPoC represents an adequate approach for the optimal extraction of neuronal components showing coupling of power with continuously changing behaviorally relevant parameters. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {We show how to use "complementary priors" to eliminate the explaining-away effects that make inference difficult in densely connected belief nets that have many hidden layers. Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

abstract = {Background Automatic sleep scoring is essential owing to the fact that conventionally a large volume of data have to be analyzed visually by the physicians which is onerous, time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, there is a dire need of an automated sleep staging scheme. New method In this work, we decompose sleep-EEG signal segments using tunable-Q factor wavelet transform (TQWT). Various spectral features are then computed from TQWT sub-bands. The performance of spectral features in the TQWT domain has been determined by intuitive and graphical analyses, statistical validation, and Fisher criteria. Random forest is used to perform classification. Optimal choices and the effects of TQWT and random forest parameters have been determined and expounded. Results Experimental outcomes manifest the efficacy of our feature generation scheme in terms of p-values of ANOVA analysis and Fisher criteria. The proposed scheme yields 90.38{\%}, 91.50{\%}, 92.11{\%}, 94.80{\%}, 97.50{\%} for 6-stage to 2-stage classification of sleep states on the benchmark Sleep-EDF data-set. In addition, its performance on DREAMS Subjects Data-set is also promising. Comparison with existing methods The performance of the proposed method is significantly better than the existing ones in terms of accuracy and Cohen's kappa coefficient. Additionally, the proposed scheme gives high detection accuracy for sleep stages non-REM 1 and REM. Conclusions Spectral features in the TQWT domain can discriminate sleep-EEG signals corresponding to various sleep states efficaciously. The proposed scheme will alleviate the burden of the physicians, speed-up sleep disorder diagnosis, and expedite sleep research.},

abstract = {The paper offers a new methodology for modelling, recognition and understanding of electroencephalography (EEG) spatio-temporal data measuring complex cognitive brain processes during mental tasks. The key element is that mental tasks are performed through complex spatio-temporal brain processes and they can be better understood only if we model properly the spatio-/spectro temporal data that measures these processes. The proposed methodology is based on a recently proposed novel spiking neural network architecture, called NeuCube as a general framework for spatio-temporal brain data modelling. The methodology is demonstrated on benchmark cognitive EEG data. The new approach leads to a faster data processing, improved accuracy of the EEG data classification and improved understanding of this data and the cognitive processes that generated it. The paper concluded that the new methodology is worth exploring further on other spatio-temporal data, measuring complex cognitive brain processes, aiming at using this method for the development of the next generation of brain-computer interfaces and systems for early diagnosis of degenerative brain disease, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and for personalised neuro-rehabilitation systems.},

Fifteen healthy participants ran at a self-selected speed with typical arm swing, with one arm restrained and with both arms restrained.

Running with one arm restrained resulted in increased frontal plane knee and hip angles, decreased foot strike angle, and decreased centre of mass vertical displacement compared to typical arm swing or bilateral arm swing restriction. Stride length was decreased and step frequency increased when running with one or both arms restrained.

Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given.

METHODS We evaluated risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA), and other gastric cancers (OGA) using data from a population-based case-control study conducted in Connecticut, New Jersey, and western Washington state. Dietary/lifestyle patterns were created using principal component analysis (PCA). Impact of the resultant scores on cancer risk was estimated through logistic regression. RESULTS PCA identified six patterns: meat/nitrite, fruit/vegetable, smoking/alcohol, legume/meat alternate, GERD/BMI, and fish/vitamin C. Risk of each cancer under study increased with rising meat/nitrite score. Risk of EA increased with increasing GERD/BMI score, and risk of ESCC rose with increasing smoking/alcohol score and decreasing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)/body mass index (BMI) score. Fruit/vegetable scores were inversely associated with EA, ESCC, and GCA. CONCLUSIONS PCA may provide a useful approach for summarizing extensive dietary/lifestyle data into fewer interpretable combinations that discriminate between cancer cases and controls. The analyses suggest that meat/nitrite intake is associated with elevated risk of each cancer under study, whereas fruit/vegetable intake reduces risk of EA, ESCC, and GCA. GERD/obesity were confirmed as risk factors for EA and smoking/alcohol as risk factors for ESCC.},

abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow users to control a computer application by brain activity as acquired (e.g., by EEG). In our classic machine learning approach to BCIs, the participants undertake a calibration measurement without feedback to acquire data to train the BCI system. After the training, the user can control a BCI and improve the operation through some type of feedback. However, not all BCI users are able to perform sufficiently well during feedback operation. In fact, a nonnegligible portion of participants (estimated 15{\%}--30{\%}) cannot control the system (a BCI illiteracy problem, generic to all motor-imagery-based BCIs). We hypothesize that one main difficulty for a BCI user is the transition from offline calibration to online feedback. In this work, we therefore investigate adaptive machine learning methods to eliminate offline calibration and analyze the performance of 11 volunteers in a BCI based on the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms. We present an adaptation scheme that individually guides the user initially starting from a subject-independent classifier operating on simple features to a subject-optimized state-of-the-art classifier within one session while the user interacts continuously. These initial runs use supervised techniques for robust coadaptive learning of user and machine. Subsequent runs use unsupervised adaptation to track the features' drift during the session and provide an unbiased measure of BCI performance. Using this approach, without any offline calibration measurement, six users, including one novice, obtained good performance after 3 to 6 minutes of adaptation. More important, this novel guided learning also allows participants with BCI illiteracy to gain significant control with the BCI in less than 60 minutes. In addition, one volunteer without sensorimotor idle rhythm peak at the beginning of the BCI experiment developed it during the course of the session and used voluntary modulation of its amplitude to control the feedback application.},

abstract = {In speaker verification (SV) systems based on Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM), normalization is an important component in the decision stage. Many normalization methods including the T- and Z-norms, have been proposed and investigated and these have contributed to state-of-the-art SV systems which have extremely low equal-error rates (EERs). In this paper, we consider application of both T- and Z-norms to a carefully selected subset of speakers using a data driven approach which can significantly reduce computation resulting in faster SV decisions and lower EER. Unfortunately, selection of the subset is critical and must be representative of the entire speaker model space otherwise error rates will increase. In order to properly select the subset of speakers for the normalizations, we propose a novel method which first clusters the speaker models using the K-means algorithm and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and then selects a set of speakers within the cluster. We evaluate the approach using both the TIMIT, NTIMIT and NIST-2002 corpora and compare against standard T- and Z-normalizations. {\textcopyright}2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {An electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis system for single-trial classification of motor imagery (MI) data is proposed in this study. Unsupervised fuzzy Hopfield neural network (FHNN) clustering, together with active segment selection and multiresolution fractal features, is used in the classification of left and right MI data. Active segment selection is used to obtain the active segment in the time-scale domain with the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics. The multiresolution fractal features are then extracted from the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) data by using the modified fractal dimension. Finally, FHNN clustering is used as the discriminant of multiresolution fractal features. FHNN clustering is capable of making flexible partitions of a finite data set, and it is an unsupervised and robust approach suitable for the classification of non-stationary biomedical signals. Compared with several popular supervised classifiers, FHNN clustering achieves promising results in classification accuracy. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Speech conveys different yet mixed information ranging from linguistic to speaker-specific components, and each of them should be exclusively used in a specific task. However, it is extremely difficult to extract a specific information component given the fact that nearly all existing acoustic representations carry all types of speech information. Thus, the use of the same representation in both speech and speaker recognition hinders a system from producing better perfor- mance due to interference of irrelevant information. In this paper, we present a deep neural architecture to extract speaker-specific information from MFCCs. As a result, a multi-objective loss function is proposed for learning speaker-specific characteristics and regularization via normalizing interference of non-speaker re- lated information and avoiding information loss. With LDC benchmark corpora and a Chinese speech corpus, we demonstrate that a resultant speaker-specific rep- resentation is insensitive to text/languages spoken and environmental mismatches and hence outperforms MFCCs and other state-of-the-art techniques in speaker recognition. We discuss relevant issues and relate our approach to previous work.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE In this study we aimed for the classification of operator workload as it is expected in many real-life workplace environments. We explored brain-signal based workload predictors that differ with respect to the level of label information required for training, including entirely unsupervised approaches. APPROACH Subjects executed a task on a touch screen that required continuous effort of visual and motor processing with alternating difficulty. We first employed classical approaches for workload state classification that operate on the sensor space of EEG and compared those to the performance of three state-of-the-art spatial filtering methods: common spatial patterns (CSPs) analysis, which requires binary label information; source power co-modulation (SPoC) analysis, which uses the subjects' error rate as a target function; and canonical SPoC (cSPoC) analysis, which solely makes use of cross-frequency power correlations induced by different states of workload and thus represents an unsupervised approach. Finally, we investigated the effects of fusing brain signals and peripheral physiological measures (PPMs) and examined the added value for improving classification performance. MAIN RESULTS Mean classification accuracies of 94{\%}, 92{\%} and 82{\%} were achieved with CSP, SPoC, cSPoC, respectively. These methods outperformed the approaches that did not use spatial filtering and they extracted physiologically plausible components. The performance of the unsupervised cSPoC is significantly increased by augmenting it with PPM features. SIGNIFICANCE Our analyses ensured that the signal sources used for classification were of cortical origin and not contaminated with artifacts. Our findings show that workload states can be successfully differentiated from brain signals, even when less and less information from the experimental paradigm is used, thus paving the way for real-world applications in which label information may be noisy or entirely unavailable.},

abstract = {The autoregressive (AR) model is widely used in electroencephalogram (EEG) analyses such as waveform fitting, spectrum estimation, and system identification. In real applications, EEGs are inevitably contaminated with unexpected outlier artifacts, and this must be overcome. However, most of the current AR models are based on the L2 norm structure, which exaggerates the outlier effect due to the square property of the L2 norm. In this paper, a novel AR object function is constructed in the Lp (p??? 1) norm space with the aim to compress the outlier effects on EEG analysis, and a fast iteration procedure is developed to solve this new AR model. The quantitative evaluation using simulated EEGs with outliers proves that the proposed Lp (p??? 1) AR can estimate the AR parameters more robustly than the Yule-Walker, Burg and LS methods, under various simulated outlier conditions. The actual application to the resting EEG recording with ocular artifacts also demonstrates that Lp (p??? 1) AR can effectively address the outliers and recover a resting EEG power spectrum that is more consistent with its physiological basis.},

abstract = {All brain-computer interface (BCI) groups that have published results of studies involving a large number of users performing BCI control based on the voluntary modulation of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) report that BCI control could not be achieved by a non-negligible number of subjects (estimated 20{\%} to 25{\%}). This failure of the BCI system to read the intention of the user is one of the greatest problems and challenges in BCI research. There are two main causes for this problem in SMR-based BCI systems: either no idle SMR is observed over motor areas of the user, or this idle rhythm is not modulated during motor imagery, resulting in a classification performance lower than 70{\%} (criterion level) that renders the control of a BCI application (like a speller) difficult or impossible. Previously, we introduced the concept of machine learning based co-adaptive calibration, which provided substantially improved performance for a variety of users. Here, we use a similar approach and investigate to what extent co-adaptive learning enables significant BCI control for completely novice users, as well as for those who could not achieve control with a conventional SMR-based BCI.},

abstract = {The concept of speaker recognition using i-vectors was recently introduced offering state-of-the-art performance. An i-vector is a compact representation of a speaker's utterance after projection into a low-dimensional, total variability subspace trained using factor analysis. A secondary process involving linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is then used to improve the discrimination of i-vectors from different speakers. The newness of this technology invokes the question as to the best way to train the total variability subspace and LDA matrix when using speech collected from distinctly different sources. This paper presents a comparative study of a number of subspace training techniques and a novel source-normalised-and-weighted LDA algorithm for the purpose of improving i-vector-based speaker recognition under mis-matched evaluation conditions. Results from the NIST 2010 speaker recognition evaluation (SRE) suggest that accounting for source conditions in the LDA matrix as opposed to the total variability subspace training regime provides improved robustness to mis-matched evaluation conditions.},

They are also used in both brain computer and brain machine interface systems with assistance, rehabilitative, and entertainment applications. Despite the broad interest in clinical applications, the use of brain signals has been only recently investigated by the scientific community as a biometric characteristic to be used in automatic people recognition systems. However, brain signals present some peculiarities, not shared by the most commonly used biometrics, such as face, iris, and fingerprints, with reference to privacy compliance, robustness against spoofing attacks, possibility to perform continuous identification, intrinsic liveness detection, and universality. These peculiarities make the use of brain signals appealing. On the other hand, there are many challenges which need to be properly addressed. The understanding of the level of uniqueness and permanence of brain responses, the design of elicitation protocols, and the invasiveness of the acquisition process are only few of the challenges which need to be tackled. In this paper, we further speculate on those issues, which represent an obstacle toward the deployment of biometric systems based on the analysis of brain activity in real life applications and intend to provide a critical and comprehensive review of state-of-the-art methods for electroencephalogram-based automatic user recognition, also reporting neurophysiological evidences related to the performed claims.},

The DNN, which is trained to discriminate between speakers, maps variable-length utterances to fixed-dimensional embeddings that we call x-vectors. Prior studies have found that embeddings leverage large-scale training datasets better than i-vectors. However, it can be challenging to collect substantial quantities of labeled data for train- ing. We use data augmentation, consisting of added noise and rever- beration, as an inexpensive method to multiply the amount of train- ing data and improve robustness. The x-vectors are compared with i-vector baselines on Speakers in the Wild and NIST SRE 2016 Can- tonese. We find that while augmentation is beneficial in the PLDA classifier, it is not helpful in the i-vector extractor. However, the x-vector DNN effectively exploits data augmentation, due to its su- pervised training. As a result, the x-vectors achieve superior perfor- mance on the evaluation datasets.},

However, the typical BCI system is designed specifically for one particular BCI method and is, therefore, not suited to the systematic studies that are essential for continued progress. In response to this problem, we have developed a documented general-purpose BCI research and development platform called BCI2000. BCI2000 can incorporate alone or in combination any brain signals, signal processing methods, output devices, and operating protocols. This report is intended to describe to investigators, biomedical engineers, and computer scientists the concepts that the BC12000 system is based upon and gives examples of successful BCI implementations using this system. To date, we have used BCI2000 to create BCI systems for a variety of brain signals, processing methods, and applications. The data show that these systems function well in online operation and that BCI2000 satisfies the stringent real-time requirements of BCI systems. By substantially reducing labor and cost, BCI2000 facilitates the implementation of different BCI systems and other psychophysiological experiments. It is available with full documentation and free of charge for research or educational purposes and is currently being used in a variety of studies by many research groups.},

abstract = {Approximately over 50 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy. Traditional diagnosis of epilepsy relies on tedious visual screening by highly trained clinicians from lengthy EEG recording that contains the presence of seizure (ictal) activities. Nowadays, there are many automatic systems that can recognize seizure-related EEG signals to help the diagnosis. However, it is very costly and inconvenient to obtain long-term EEG data with seizure activities, especially in areas short of medical resources. We demonstrate in this paper that we can use the interictal scalp EEG data, which is much easier to collect than the ictal data, to automatically diagnose whether a person is epileptic. In our automated EEG recognition system, we extract three classes of features from the EEG data and build Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) fed with these features. We optimize the feature extraction parameters and combine these PNNs through a voting mechanism. As a result, our system achieves an impressive 94.07{\%} accuracy, which is very close to reported human recognition accuracy by experienced medical professionals.},

abstract = {In this article, we have discussed recent progress in quantifying the genetically determined component of the resting EEG. This progress has been made possible in particular by the application of advanced information processing techniques such as "supervised learning," and the development of a problem-oriented "similarity" concept. Our work aimed at modeling previous findings regarding the distinct individuality of human brain-wave patterns, the high similarity between the EEGs of monozygotic twins, and the average within-pair similarity of dizygotic twins. Thus, we had three objectives: First, we wanted to improve the quantification of EEG characteristics with respect to reproducibility and specificity by means of adaptive procedures and repeated measurements. Second, we wanted to compare the "typical" within-subject EEG similarity with the "typical" within-pair EEG similarity of monozygotic and dizygotic twins brought up together. Finally, we were interested in the degree to which environmental factors affect the characteristics of human brain-wave patterns. Our investigations were based on the empirical data derived from five different populations: (1) 81 healthy subjects, (2) 24 pairs of monozygotic twins brought up together, (3) 25 pairs of dizygotic twins brought up together, (4) 28 pairs of monozygotic twins reared apart, and (5) 21 pairs of dizygotic twins reared apart. Following our similarity conception, repeated measurements on the set of 81 individuals were used as design samples, and new registrations from the same individuals taken 14 days later were referred to as test samples in order to develop the appropriate method and to determine all required calibration parameters. This specific approach allowed us to construct EEG spectral patterns which, with a specificity and reproducibility of greater than 90{\%} each, largely met the requirements of genetic EEG studies. Hence, we were able systematically to investigate the within-pair EEG similarity of our twin samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {A brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication from the brain to devices, bypassing the traditional pathway of peripheral nerves and muscles. Traditional approaches to BCIs require the user to train for weeks or even months to learn to control the BCI. In contrast, BCIs based on machine learning only require a calibration session of less than an hour before the system can be used, since the machine adapts to the user's existing brain signals. However, this calibration session has to be repeated before each use of the BCI due to inter-session variability, which makes using a BCI still a time-consuming and an error-prone enterprise. In this work, we present a second-order baselining procedure that reduces these variations, and enables the creation of a BCI that can be applied to new subjects without such a calibration session. The method was validated with a motor-imagery classification task performed by 109 subjects. Results showed that our subject-independent BCI without calibration performs as well as the popular common spatial patterns (CSP)-based BCI that does use a calibration session.},

abstract = {An attempt was made at using a small computer to recognize and quantify interictal epileptic activity (spikes and sharp waves) in the human scalp EEG. To perform the automatic recognition, the EEG of each channel is broken down into half-waves. A half-wave is characterized by its duration and its amplitude relative to the background activity. A wave is characterized by the durations and amplitudes of its two component half-waves, by the second derivative at its apex measured relative to the background activity, and by the duration and amplitude of the following half-wave. Particular combinations of these parameters were found to characterize spikes and sharp waves and are used for their recognition and quantification. Specific methods are used for the rejection of spike-like or sharp wave-like wave forms such as eye blinks, muscle potentials and sharp alpha activity and were found to perform with a high level of reliability. Interchannel relationships are thoroughly examined to determine areas of maximal epileptogenicity. Sixteen channels can be analyzed in real time. Results are presented in a simple picture containing localizing and quantitative information. Specific questions regarding the time relationships of spikes in different channels can be asked interactively by the user. The system is of potential use in clinical electroencephalography. ?? 1976.},

There is significant variability in patient populations undergoing CCEEG and in technical specifications for CCEEG performance. METHODS The Critical Care Continuous EEG Task Force of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society developed expert consensus recommendations on the use of CCEEG in critically ill adults and children. RECOMMENDATIONS The consensus panel describes the qualifications and responsibilities of CCEEG personnel including neurodiagnostic technologists and interpreting physicians. The panel outlines required equipment for CCEEG, including electrodes, EEG machine and amplifier specifications, equipment for polygraphic data acquisition, EEG and video review machines, central monitoring equipment, and network, remote access, and data storage equipment. The consensus panel also describes how CCEEG should be acquired, reviewed and interpreted. The panel suggests methods for patient selection and triage; initiation of CCEEG; daily maintenance of CCEEG; electrode removal and infection control; quantitative EEG techniques; EEG and behavioral monitoring by non-physician personnel; review, interpretation, and reports; and data storage protocols. CONCLUSION Recommended qualifications for CCEEG personnel and CCEEG technical specifications will facilitate standardization of this emerging technology.},

abstract = {Epileptic seizures are manifestations of epilepsy. Careful analyses of the electroencephalograph (EEG) records can provide valuable insight and improved understanding of the mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. The detection of epileptiform discharges in the EEG is an important component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. As EEG signals are non-stationary, the conventional method of frequency analysis is not highly successful in diagnostic classification. This paper deals with a novel method of analysis of EEG signals using wavelet transform and classification using artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression (LR). Wavelet transform is particularly effective for representing various aspects of non-stationary signals such as trends, discontinuities and repeated patterns where other signal processing approaches fail or are not as effective. Through wavelet decomposition of the EEG records, transient features are accurately captured and localized in both time and frequency context. In epileptic seizure classification we used lifting-based discrete wavelet transform (LBDWT) as a preprocessing method to increase the computational speed. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational load of those algorithms that were based on classical wavelet transform (CWT). In this study, we introduce two fundamentally different approaches for designing classification models (classifiers) the traditional statistical method based on logistic regression and the emerging computationally powerful techniques based on ANN. Logistic regression as well as multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of EEG signals. In these methods we used LBDWT coefficients of EEG signals as an input to classification system with two discrete outputs: epileptic seizure or non-epileptic seizure. By identifying features in the signal we want to provide an automatic system that will support a physician in the diagnosing process. By applying LBDWT in connection with MLPNN, we obtained novel and reliable classifier architecture. The comparisons between the developed classifiers were primarily based on analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves as well as a number of scalar performance measures pertaining to the classification. The MLPNN based classifier outperformed the LR based counterpart. Within the same group, the MLPNN based classifier was more accurate than the LR based classifier.},

abstract = {The human brain is often considered to be the most cognitively capable among mammalian brains and to be much larger than expected for a mammal of our body size. Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 +/- 8.1 billion NeuN-positive cells ("neurons") and 84.6 +/- 9.8 billion NeuN-negative ("nonneuronal") cells. With only 19{\%} of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82{\%} of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain.},

abstract = {We have devised a new class of fast adaptation techniques for speech recognition. These techniques are based on prior knowledge of speaker variation, obtained by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or a similar technique to T vectors of dimension D derived from T speaker-dependent models. This offline step yields T basis vectors called ``eigenvoices''. We constrain the model for new speaker S to be located in the space spanned by the first K eigenvoices. Speaker adaptation involves estimating the K eigenvoice coefficients for the new speaker; typically, K is very small compared to D. We conducted mean adaptation experiments on the Isolet database. With a large amount of supervised adaptation data, most eigenvoice techniques performed slightly better than MAP or MLLR; with small amounts of supervised adaptation data or for unsupervised adaptation, some eigenvoice techniques performed much better. We believe that the eigenvoice approach would yield rapid adaptation for most speech recognition systems.},

Systems employed to detect seizures may have the potential to improve outcomes in these patients by allowing more tailored therapies and might, additionally, have a role in accident and SUDEP prevention. Automated seizure detection and prediction require algorithms which employ feature computation and subsequent classification. Over the last few decades, methods have been developed to detect seizures utilizing scalp and intracranial EEG, electrocardiography, accelerometry and motion sensors, electrodermal activity, and audio/video captures. To date, it is unclear which combination of detection technologies yields the best results, and approaches may ultimately need to be individualized.

The aim of this paper is to find optimal signal processing methods and machine learning algorithms to achieve online sleep staging on the basis of a single EEG signal. The classification performance obtained using six different EEG signals and various signal processing feature sets is compared using the kappa statistic which has very recently become popular in sleep staging research. A variable duration of the EEG segment (or epoch) to decide on the sleep stage is also analyzed. Spectral-domain, time-domain, linear, and nonlinear features are compared in terms of performance and two types of machine learning approaches (random forests and support vector machines) are assessed. We have determined that frontal EEG signals, with spectral linear features, epoch durations between 18 and 30 seconds, and a random forest classifier lead to optimal classification performance while ensuring real-time online operation.},

abstract = {Detecting artifacts produced in EEG data by muscle activity, eye blinks and electrical noise is a common and important problem in EEG research. It is now widely accepted that independent component analysis (ICA) may be a useful tool for isolating artifacts and/or cortical processes from electroencephalographic (EEG) data. We present results of simulations demonstrating that ICA decomposition, here tested using three popular ICA algorithms, Infomax, SOBI, and FastICA, can allow more sensitive automated detection of small non-brain artifacts than applying the same detection methods directly to the scalp channel data. We tested the upper bound performance of five methods for detecting various types of artifacts by separately optimizing and then applying them to artifact-free EEG data into which we had added simulated artifacts of several types, ranging in size from thirty times smaller (- 50??dB) to the size of the EEG data themselves (0??dB). Of the methods tested, those involving spectral thresholding were most sensitive. Except for muscle artifact detection where we found no gain of using ICA, all methods proved more sensitive when applied to the ICA-decomposed data than applied to the raw scalp data: the mean performance for ICA was higher and situated at about two standard deviations away from the performance distribution obtained on raw data. We note that ICA decomposition also allows simple subtraction of artifacts accounted for by single independent components, and/or separate and direct examination of the decomposed non-artifact processes themselves. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION The ability to continuously and unobtrusively monitor levels of task engagement and mental workload in an operational environment could be useful in identifying more accurate and efficient methods for humans to interact with technology. This information could also be used to optimize the design of safer, more efficient work environments that increase motivation and productivity. METHODS The present study explored the feasibility of monitoring electroencephalo-graphic (EEG) indices of engagement and workload acquired unobtrusively and quantified during performance of cognitive tests. EEG was acquired from 80 healthy participants with a wireless sensor headset (F3-F4,C3-C4,Cz-POz,F3-Cz,Fz-C3,Fz-POz) during tasks including: multi-level forward/backward-digit-span, grid-recall, trails, mental-addition, 20-min 3-Choice Vigilance, and image-learning and memory tests. EEG metrics for engagement and workload were calculated for each 1 -s of EEG. RESULTS Across participants, engagement but not workload decreased over the 20-min vigilance test. Engagement and workload were significantly increased during the encoding period of verbal and image-learning and memory tests when compared with the recognition/ recall period. Workload but not engagement increased linearly as level of difficulty increased in forward and backward-digit-span, grid-recall, and mental-addition tests. EEG measures correlated with both subjective and objective performance metrics. DISCUSSION These data in combination with previous studies suggest that EEG engagement reflects information-gathering, visual processing, and allocation of attention. EEG workload increases with increasing working memory load and during problem solving, integration of information, analytical reasoning, and may be more reflective of executive functions. Inspection of EEG on a second-by-second timescale revealed associations between workload and engagement levels when aligned with specific task events providing preliminary evidence that second-by-second classifications reflect parameters of task performance.},

Then, a Within-Class Covariance Normalization technique is used for session variability compensation. Finally, a least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) is applied to estimate the age of speakers. The proposed method is trained and tested on telephone conversations of the National Institute for Standard and Technology (NIST) 2010 and 2008 speaker recognition evaluation databases. Evaluation results show that the proposed method yields significantly lower mean absolute error and higher Pearson correlation coefficient between chronological speaker age and estimated speaker age compared to different conventional schemes. The obtained relative improvements of mean absolute error and correlation coefficient compared to our best baseline system are around 5{\%} and 2{\%} respectively. Finally, the effect of some major factors influencing the proposed age estimation system, namely utterance length and spoken language are analyzed. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background In controlled laboratory EEG experiments, researchers carefully mark events and analyze subject responses time-locked to these events. Unfortunately, such markers may not be available or may come with poor timing resolution for experiments conducted in less-controlled naturalistic environments. New method We present an integrated event-identification method for identifying particular responses that occur in unlabeled continuously recorded EEG signals based on information from recordings of other subjects potentially performing related tasks. We introduce the idea of timing slack and timing-tolerant performance measures to deal with jitter inherent in such non-time-locked systems. We have developed an implementation available as an open-source MATLAB toolbox (http://github.com/VisLab/EEG-Annotate) and have made test data available in a separate data note. Results We applied the method to identify visual presentation events (both target and non-target) in data from an unlabeled subject using labeled data from other subjects with good sensitivity and specificity. The method also identified actual visual presentation events in the data that were not previously marked in the experiment. Comparison with existing methods Although the method uses traditional classifiers for initial stages, the problem of identifying events based on the presence of stereotypical EEG responses is the converse of the traditional stimulus-response paradigm and has not been addressed in its current form. Conclusions In addition to identifying potential events in unlabeled or incompletely labeled EEG, these methods also allow researchers to investigate whether particular stereotypical neural responses are present in other circumstances. Timing-tolerance has the added benefit of accommodating inter- and intra- subject timing variations.},

abstract = {The intrarater and interrater reliability (I{\&}IR) of EEG interpretation has significant implications for the value of EEG as a diagnostic tool. We measured both the intrarater reliability and the interrater reliability of EEG interpretation based on the interpretation of complete EEGs into standard diagnostic categories and rater confidence in their interpretations and investigated sources of variance in EEG interpretations. During two distinct time intervals, six board-certified clinical neurophysiologists classified 300 EEGs into one or more of seven diagnostic categories and assigned a subjective confidence to their interpretations. Each EEG was read by three readers. Each reader interpreted 150 unique studies, and 50 studies were re-interpreted to generate intrarater data. A generalizability study assessed the contribution of subjects, readers, and the interaction between subjects and readers to interpretation variance. Five of the six readers had a median confidence of ≥99{\%}, and the upper quartile of confidence values was 100{\%} for all six readers. Intrarater Cohen's kappa ($\kappa$c) ranged from 0.33 to 0.73 with an aggregated value of 0.59. Cohen's kappa ranged from 0.29 to 0.62 for the 15 reader pairs, with an aggregated Fleiss kappa of 0.44 for interrater agreement. Cohen's kappa was not significantly different across rater pairs (chi-square=17.3, df=14, p=0.24). Variance due to subjects (i.e., EEGs) was 65.3{\%}, due to readers was 3.9{\%}, and due to the interaction between readers and subjects was 30.8{\%}. Experienced epileptologists have very high confidence in their EEG interpretations and low to moderate I{\&}IR, a common paradox in clinical medicine. A necessary, but insufficient, condition to improve EEG interpretation accuracy is to increase intrarater and interrater reliability. This goal could be accomplished, for instance, with an automated online application integrated into a continuing medical education module that measures and reports EEG I{\&}IR to individual users. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The algorithm is based on a novel, artificial neural network, called a "Siamese" neural network. This network consists of two identical sub-networks joined at their out-puts. During training the two sub-networks extract features from two signatures, while the joining neuron measures the distance be-tween the two feature vectors. Verification consists of comparing an extracted feature vector {\~{}}ith a stored feature vector for the signer. Signatures closer to this stored representation than a chosen thresh-old are accepted, all other signatures are rejected as forgeries.},

abstract = {The paper deals with the f-divergences of Csiszar generalizing the discrimination information of Kullback, the total variation distance, the Hellinger divergence, and the Pearson divergence. All basic properties of f-divergences including relations to the decision errors are proved in a new manner replacing the classical Jensen inequality by a new generalized Taylor expansion of convex functions. Some new properties are proved too, e.g., relations to the statistical sufficiency and deficiency. The generalized Taylor expansion also shows very easily that all f-divergences are average statistical informations (differences between prior and posterior Bayes errors) mutually differing only in the weights imposed on various prior distributions. The statistical information introduced by De Groot and the classical information of Shannon are shown to be extremal cases corresponding to alpha=0 and alpha=1 in the class of the so-called Arimoto alpha-informations introduced in this paper for 0{\textless}alpha{\textless}1 by means of the Arimoto alpha-entropies. Some new examples of f-divergences are introduced as well, namely, the Shannon divergences and the Arimoto alpha-divergences leading for alphauarr1 to the Shannon divergences. Square roots of all these divergences are shown to be metrics satisfying the triangle inequality. The last section introduces statistical tests and estimators based on the minimal f-divergence with the empirical distribution achieved in the families of hypothetic distributions. For the Kullback divergence this leads to the classical likelihood ratio test and estimator},

In this paper, two main contributions are presented and validated: the use of non-linear classifiers through the so-called kernel trick and the proposal of a Bag-of-Words model for extracting a non-linear feature representation of the input data in an unsupervised manner. The performance of the resulting system is validated with public datasets, previously processed to remove artifacts or external disturbances, but also with private datasets recorded under realistic and non-ideal operating conditions. The use of public datasets caters for comparison purposes whereas the private one shows the performance of the system under realistic circumstances of noise, artifacts, and signals of different amplitudes. Moreover, the proposed solution has been compared to state-of-the-art works not only for pre-processed and public datasets but also with the private datasets. The mean F1-measure shows a 10{\%} improvement over the second-best ranked method including cross-dataset experiments. The obtained results prove the robustness of the proposed solution to more realistic and variable conditions.},

@article{Haufe2013,
abstract = {Information flow between brain areas is difficult to estimate from EEG measurements due to the presence of noise as well as due to volume conduction. We here test the ability of popular measures of effective connectivity to detect an underlying neuronal interaction from simulated EEG data, as well as the ability of commonly used inverse source reconstruction techniques to improve the connectivity estimation. We find that volume conduction severely limits the neurophysiological interpretability of sensor-space connectivity analyses. Moreover, it may generally lead to conflicting results depending on the connectivity measure and statistical testing approach used. In particular, we note that the application of Granger-causal (GC) measures combined with standard significance testing leads to the detection of spurious connectivity regardless of whether the analysis is performed on sensor-space data or on sources estimated using three different established inverse methods. This empirical result follows from the definition of GC. The phase-slope index (PSI) does not suffer from this theoretical limitation and therefore performs well on our simulated data.We develop a theoretical framework to characterize artifacts of volume conduction, which may still be present even in reconstructed source time series as zero-lag correlations, and to distinguish their time-delayed brain interaction. Based on this theory we derive a procedure which suppresses the influence of volume conduction, but preserves effects related to time-lagged brain interaction in connectivity estimates. This is achieved by using time-reversed data as surrogates for statistical testing. We demonstrate that this robustification makes Granger-causal connectivity measures applicable to EEG data, achieving similar results as PSI. Integrating the insights of our study, we provide a guidance for measuring brain interaction from EEG data. Software for generating benchmark data is made available. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in the use of brain activity for biometric systems. However, so far these studies have focused mainly on basic features of the Electroencephalography. In this study we propose an approach based on phase synchronization, to investigate personal distinctive brain network organization. To this end, the importance, in terms of centrality, of different regions was determined on the basis of EEG recordings. We hypothesized that nodal centrality enables the accurate identification of individuals. EEG signals from a cohort of 109 64-channels EEGs were band-pass filtered in the classical frequency bands and functional connectivity between the sensors was estimated using the Phase Lag Index. The resulting connectivity matrix was used to construct a weighted network, from which the nodal Eigenvector Centrality was computed. Nodal centrality was successively used as feature vector. Highest recognition rates were observed in the gamma band (equal error rate ( EER) = 0.044) and high beta band ( EER = 0.102). Slightly lower recognition rate was observed in the low beta band ( EER = 0.144), while poor recognition rates were observed for the others frequency bands. The reported results show that resting-state functional brain network topology provides better classification performance than using only a measure of functional connectivity, and may represent an optimal solution for the design of next generation EEG based biometric systems. This study also suggests that results from biometric systems based on high-frequency scalp EEG features should be interpreted with caution.},

abstract = {The idea of ‘probabilistic distances' (also called divergences), which in some sense as- sess how ‘close' two probability distributions are from one another, has been widely employed in probability, statistics, information theory, and related fields. Of particular importance due to their generality and applicability are the R{\'{e}}nyi divergence measures. While the closely related concept of R{\'{e}}nyi entropy of a probability distribution has been studied extensively, and closed-form expressions for the most common univariate and multivariate continuous distributions have been obtained and compiled [57, 45, 62], the literature currently lacks the corresponding compilation for continuous R{\'{e}}nyi di- vergences. The present thesis addresses this issue for the analytically tractable cases. Closed-form expressions for Kullback-Leibler divergences are also derived and com- piled, as they can be seen as an extension by continuity of the R{\'{e}}nyi divergences. Ad- ditionally, we establish a connection between R{\'{e}}nyi divergence and the variance of the log-likelihood ratio of two distributions, which extends the work of Song [57] on the relation between R{\'{e}}nyi entropy and the log-likelihood function, and which becomes practically useful in light of the R{\'{e}}nyi divergence expressions we have derived. Lastly, we consider the R{\'{e}}nyi divergence rate between two stationary Gaussian processes.},

abstract = {We introduce and compare several strategies for learning discriminative features from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings using deep learning techniques. EEG data are generally only available in small quantities, they are high-dimensional with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, and there is considerable variability between individual subjects and recording sessions. Our proposed techniques specifically address these challenges for feature learning. Cross-trial encoding forces auto-encoders to focus on features that are stable across trials. Similarity-constraint encoders learn features that allow to distinguish between classes by demanding that two trials from the same class are more similar to each other than to trials from other classes. This tuple-based training approach is especially suitable for small datasets. Hydra-nets allow for separate processing pathways adapting to subsets of a dataset and thus combine the advantages of individual feature learning (better adaptation of early, low-level processing) with group model training (better generalization of higher-level processing in deeper layers). This way, models can, for instance, adapt to each subject individually to compensate for differences in spatial patterns due to anatomical differences or variance in electrode positions. The different techniques are evaluated using the publicly available OpenMIIR dataset of EEG recordings taken while participants listened to and imagined music.},

abstract = {Many closed-loop, continuous-control brain-machine interface (BMI) architectures rely on decoding via a linear readout of noisy population neural activity. However, recent work has found that decomposing neural population activity into correlated and uncorrelated variability reveals that improvements in cursor control coincide with the emergence of correlated neural variability. In order to address how correlated and uncorrelated neural variability arises and contributes to BMI cursor control, we simulate a neural population receiving combinations of shared inputs affecting all cells and private inputs affecting only individual cells. When simulating BMI cursor-control with different populations, we find that correlated activity generates faster, straighter cursor trajectories, yet sometimes at the cost of inaccuracies. We also find that correlated variability can be generated from either shared inputs or quickly updated private inputs. Overall, our results suggest a role for both correlated and uncorrelated neural activity in cursor control, and potential mechanisms by which correlated activity may emerge.},

abstract = {Despite several approaches to realize subject-to-subject transfer of pre-trained classifiers, the full performance of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for a novel user can only be reached by presenting the BCI system with data from the novel user. In typical state-of-the-art BCI systems with a supervised classifier, the labeled data is collected during a calibration recording, in which the user is asked to perform a specific task. Based on the known labels of this recording, the BCI's classifier can learn to decode the individual's brain signals. Unfortunately, this calibration recording consumes valuable time. Furthermore, it is unproductive with respect to the final BCI application, e.g. text entry. Therefore, the calibration period must be reduced to a minimum, which is especially important for patients with a limited concentration ability. The main contribution of this manuscript is an online study on unsupervised learning in an auditory event-related potential (ERP) paradigm. Our results demonstrate that the calibration recording can be bypassed by utilizing an unsupervised trained classifier, that is initialized randomly and updated during usage. Initially, the unsupervised classifier tends to make decoding mistakes, as the classifier might not have seen enough data to build a reliable model. Using a constant re-analysis of the previously spelled symbols, these initially misspelled symbols can be rectified posthoc when the classifier has learned to decode the signals. We compare the spelling performance of our unsupervised approach and of the unsupervised posthoc approach to the standard supervised calibration-based dogma for n = 10 healthy users. To assess the learning behavior of our approach, it is unsupervised trained from scratch three times per user. Even with the relatively low SNR of an auditory ERP paradigm, the results show that after a limited number of trials (30 trials), the unsupervised approach performs comparably to a classic supervised model.},

abstract = {In total variability modeling, variable length speech utterances are mapped to fixed low-dimensional i-vectors. Central to computing the total variability matrix and i-vector extraction, is the computation of the posterior distribution for a latent variable conditioned on an observed feature sequence of an utterance. In both cases the prior for the latent variable is assumed to be non-informative, since for homogeneous datasets there is no gain in generality in using an informative prior. This work shows in the heterogeneous case, that using informative priors for computing the posterior, can lead to favorable results. We focus on modeling the priors using minimum divergence criterion or factor analysis techniques. Tests on the NIST 2008 and 2010 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE) dataset show that our proposed method beats four baselines: For i-vector extraction using an already trained matrix, for the short2-short3 task in SRE'08, five out of eight female and four out of eight male common conditions, were improved. For the core-extended task in SRE'10, four out of nine female and six out of nine male common conditions were improved. When incorporating prior information into the training of the T matrix itself, the proposed method beats the baselines for six out of eight female and five out of eight male common conditions, for SRE'08, and five and six out of nine conditions, for the male and female case, respectively, for SRE'10. Tests using factor analysis for estimating priors show that two priors do not offer much improvement, but in the case of three separate priors (sparse data), considerable improvements were gained.},

We propose a method to approach this problem by trying to estimate a function f which is positive on S and negative on the complement. The functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a poten-tially small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of the weight vector in an associated feature space.

abstract = {Over the last years significant efforts have been made to develop kernels that can be applied to sequence data such as DNA, text, speech, video and images. The Fisher Kernel and similar variants have been suggested as good ways to combine an underlying generative model in the feature space and discriminant classifiers such as SVM's. In this paper we suggest an alternative procedure to the Fisher kernel for systematically finding kernel functions that naturally handle variable length sequence data in multimedia domains. In particular for domains such as speech and images we explore the use of kernel functions that take full advantage of well known probabilistic models such as Gaussian Mixtures and single full covariance Gaussian models. We derive a kernel distance based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between generative models. In effect our approach combines the best of both generative and discriminative methods and replaces the standard SVM kernels. We perform experiments on speaker identification/verification and image classification tasks and show that these new kernels have the best performance in speaker verification and mostly outperform the Fisher kernel based SVM's and the generative classifiers in speaker identification and image classification.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive and intellectual deficits and behavior disturbance. The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used as a tool for diagnosing AD for several decades. The hallmark of EEG abnormalities in AD patients is a shift of the power spectrum to lower frequencies and a decrease in coherence of fast rhythms. These abnormalities are thought to be associated with functional disconnections among cortical areas resulting from death of cortical neurons, axonal pathology, cholinergic deficits, etc. This article reviews main findings of EEG abnormalities in AD patients obtained from conventional spectral analysis and nonlinear dynamical methods. In particular, nonlinear alterations in the EEG of AD patients, i.e. a decreased complexity of EEG patterns and reduced information transmission among cortical areas, and their clinical implications are discussed. For future studies, improvement of the accuracy of differential diagnosis and early detection of AD based on multimodal approaches, longitudinal studies on nonlinear dynamics of the EEG, drug effects on the EEG dynamics, and linear and nonlinear functional connectivity among cortical regions in AD are proposed to be investigated. EEG abnormalities of AD patients are characterized by slowed mean frequency, less complex activity, and reduced coherences among cortical regions. These abnormalities suggest that the EEG has utility as a valuable tool for differential and early diagnosis of AD. ?? 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Various features and classifiers were explored with the goal of maximizing detection accuracy while minimizing power, area, and latency. Additionally, algorithmic and hardware optimizations were identified to further improve performance. The classifiers studied include {\$}k{\$}-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, naïve Bayes, and logistic regression (LR) . All feature and classifier pairs were able to obtain F1 scores over 80{\%} and onset sensitivity of 100{\%} when tested on ten patients. A fully flexible hardware system was implemented that offers parameters for the number of EEG channels, the number of features, the classifier type, and various word width resolutions. Five seizure detection processors with different classifiers have been fully placed and routed on a Virtex-5 field-programmable gate array and been compared. It was found that five features per channel with LR proved to be the best solution for the application of personalized seizure detection. LR had the best average F1 score of 91{\%}, the smallest area and power footprint, and the lowest latency. The ASIC implementation of the same combination in 65-nm CMOS shows that the processor occupies 0.008 mm2 and dissipates 19 nJ at 484 Hz.},

abstract = {Most time series data mining algorithms use similarity search as a core subroutine, and thus the time taken for similarity search is the bottleneck for virtually all time series data mining algorithms. The difficulty of scaling search to large datasets largely explains why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects, while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine truly massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following extremely unintuitive fact; in large datasets we can exactly search under DTW much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance search algorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted. We show that our ideas allow us to solve higher-level time series data mining problems at scales that would otherwise be untenable.},

This is accomplished by a new time warping method using a dynamic programming technique. A decision is made to accept or reject an identity claim, based on the overall distance.

Like many other neurological disorders, epilepsy can be assessed by the electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG signal is highly non-linear and non-stationary, and hence, it is difficult to characterize and interpret it. However, it is a well-established clinical technique with low associated costs. In this work, we propose a methodology for the automatic detection of normal, pre-ictal, and ictal conditions from recorded EEG signals. Four entropy features namely Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Sample Entropy (SampEn), Phase Entropy 1 (S1), and Phase Entropy 2 (S2) were extracted from the collected EEG signals. These features were fed to seven different classifiers: Fuzzy Sugeno Classifier (FSC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). Our results show that the Fuzzy classifier was able to differentiate the three classes with a high accuracy of 98.1{\%}. Overall, compared to previous techniques, our proposed strategy is more suitable for diagnosis of epilepsy with higher accuracy. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Signal classification is an important issue in brain computer interface (BCI) systems. Deep learning approaches have been used successfully in many recent studies to learn features and classify different types of data. However, the number of studies that employ these approaches on BCI applications is very limited. In this study we aim to use deep learning methods to improve classification performance of EEG motor imagery signals. APPROACH: In this study we investigate convolutional neural networks (CNN) and stacked autoencoders (SAE) to classify EEG Motor Imagery signals. A new form of input is introduced to combine time, frequency and location information extracted from EEG signal and it is used in CNN having one 1D convolutional and one max-pooling layers. We also proposed a new deep network by combining CNN and SAE. In this network, the features that are extracted in CNN are classified through the deep network SAE. MAIN RESULTS: The classification performance obtained by the proposed method on BCI competition IV dataset 2b in terms of kappa value is 0.547. Our approach yields 9{\%} improvement over the winner algorithm of the competition. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that deep learning methods provide better classification performance compared to other state of art approaches. These methods can be applied successfully to BCI systems where the amount of data is large due to daily recording.},

abstract = {The significance of rhythmic and periodic EEG patterns in critically ill patients is unclear. A universal terminology is needed to facilitate study of these patterns, and consistent observer agreement should be demonstrated in its use. The authors evaluated inter- and intraobserver agreement using the standardized terminology (Hirsch et al., J Clin Neurophysiol 2005;22:128-135) recently proposed by the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society. Trained electroencephalographers viewed a series of 10-second EEG samples from critically ill adults (phase I), a set of {\textgreater}/=20-minute EEGs from the same patient cohort (phase II), and then reevaluated the first sample set (phase III). The readers used the proposed terminology to "score" each EEG. For each possible term, interobserver agreement (phases I and II) and intraobserver agreement (phase III) were calculated using pairwise kappa (kappa) values. Moderate agreement beyond chance was seen for the presence/absence of rhythmic or periodic patterns and for localization of these patterns. Agreement for other terms was slight to fair. Inter- and intraobserver agreement were consistently lower for optional terms than mandatory terms. Even when standardized terminology is used, the description of rhythmic and periodic EEG patterns varies significantly. Further refinement of the proposed terminology is required to improve inter- and intraobserver agreement.},

abstract = {Most time series data mining algorithms use similarity search as a core subroutine, and thus the time taken for similarity search is the bottleneck for virtually all time series data mining algorithms. The difficulty of scaling search to large datasets largely explains why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects, while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine truly massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following extremely unintuitive fact; in large datasets we can exactly search under DTW much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance search algorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted. In particular, the largest dataset we consider is larger than the combined size of all of the time series datasets considered in all data mining papers ever published. We show that our ideas allow us to solve higher-level time series data mining problem such as motif discovery and clustering at scales that would otherwise be untenable. In addition to mining massive datasets, we will show that our ideas also have implications for real-time monitoring of data streams, allowing us to handle much faster arrival rates and/or use cheaper and lower powered devices than are currently possible.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present study is to examine the familiality of electroencephalographic (EEG) measures among affected sibling pairs with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). EEG was recorded during baseline (eyes open and eyes closed) and cognitive activation conditions on a sample of 58 children with ADHD (27 multiplex families), ages 6-18. EEG power in three frequency bands: theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (12-20 Hz) was tested for sibling correlation, familial co-segregation and association with behavioral task performance on a sustained attention task. Sibling correlation for EEG measures was moderate during baseline conditions and significantly higher for the cognitive activation condition. Familial clustering of frontal and parietal alpha power was evident, but only during the cognitive activation condition. Theta and alpha power correlated significantly with CPT response variability and omission errors, respectively. Cognitive task performance did not exhibit familial clustering in our sample. EEG measures (i.e., alpha power) recorded during cognitive activation is a strongly familial trait in ADHD and may be a putative endophenotype for ADHD.},

abstract = {Electrophysiological measures may be useful markers of the genetic underpinnings of complex behavior and psychopathology. Twin and family studies have been used to estimate the genetic contribution to the individual differences in a variety of electrophysiological measures. These studies are briefly reviewed here and published twin correlations from a number of studies with comparable methodology were selected for structural equation meta-analyses. For electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha power (11 twin groups) the heritability estimates in each of the single studies were high (averaged 79{\%}), but it was not possible to equate the twin correlations across studies in the meta-analysis. In contrast, combining the data on alpha peak frequency (five twin groups) revealed a 'meta'-heritability of 81{\%} (95{\%} CI: 76-84{\%}). Aggregating the twin correlations of five twin studies on the P300, the estimated meta-heritability is 60{\%} (95{\%} CI: 54-65{\%}) for P300 amplitude and 51{\%} (95{\%} CI: 43-58{\%}) for P300 latency. It is concluded that genomic variation contributes significantly to individual differences in all EEG and event related potential (ERP) measures studied to date. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Feature extraction for automatic classification of EEG signals typically relies on time frequency representations of the signal. Techniques such as cepstral-based filter banks or wavelets are popular analysis techniques in many signal processing applications including EEG classification. In this paper, we present a comparison of a variety of approaches to estimating and postprocessing features. To further aid in discrimination of periodic signals from aperiodic signals, we add a differential energy term. We evaluate our approaches on the TUH EEG Corpus, which is the largest publicly available EEG corpus and an exceedingly challenging task due to the clinical nature of the data. We demonstrate that a variant of a standard filter bank-based approach, coupled with first and second derivatives, provides a substantial reduction in the overall error rate. The combination of differential energy and derivatives produces a 24{\%} absolute reduction in the error rate and improves our ability to discriminate between signal events and background noise. This relatively simple approach proves to be comparable to other popular feature extraction approaches such as wavelets, but is much more computationally efficient.},

abstract = {A novel wavelet-chaos-neural network methodology is presented for classification of electroencephalograms (EEGs) into healthy, ictal, and interictal EEGs. Wavelet analysis is used to decompose the EEG into delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma sub-bands. Three parameters are employed for EEG representation: standard deviation (quantifying the signal variance), correlation dimension, and largest Lyapunov exponent (quantifying the non-linear chaotic dynamics of the signal). The classification accuracies of the following techniques are compared: 1) unsupervised-means clustering; 2) linear and quadratic discriminant analysis; 3) radial basis function neural network; 4) Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation neural network (LMBPNN). To reduce the computing time and output analysis, the research was performed in two phases: band-specific analysis and mixed-band analysis. In phase two, over 500 different combinations of mixed-band feature spaces consisting of promising parameters from phase one of the research were investigated. It is concluded that all three key components of the wavelet-chaos-neural network methodology are important for improving the EEG classification accuracy. Judicious combinations of parameters and classifiers are needed to accurately discriminate between the three types of EEGs. It was discovered that a particular mixed-band feature space consisting of nine parameters and LMBPNN result in the highest classification accuracy, a high value of 96.7{\%}.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: High-density EEG during sleep represents a powerful new tool to reveal potential abnormalities in rhythm-generating mechanisms while avoiding confounding factors associated with waking activities. As a first step in this direction, the authors employed high-density EEG to explore whether sleep rhythms differ between schizophrenia subjects, healthy individuals, and a psychiatric control group with a history of depression. METHOD: Healthy comparison subjects (N=17), medicated schizophrenia patients (N=18), and subjects with a history of depression (N=15) were recruited. Subjects were recorded during the first sleep episode of the night with a 256-electrode high-density EEG. Recordings were analyzed for changes in EEG power spectra, power topography, and sleep-specific cortical oscillations. RESULTS: The authors found that the schizophrenia group had a significant reduction in centroparietal EEG power, from 13.75 to 15.00 Hz, in relation to both the comparison and depression groups. No significant difference in EEG power between the comparison and depression groups was identified. The authors also found a decrease in sleep spindle number, amplitude, duration, and integrated spindle activity in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, integrated spindle activity had an effect size corresponding to 93.0{\%} or 90.2{\%} separation of the schizophrenia from the comparison or depression group. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep spindles are generated by the thalamic reticular nucleus in conjunction with specific thalamic nuclei and are modulated by corticothalamic and thalamocortical connections. The deficit in sleep spindles in schizophrenia subjects may reflect dysfunction in thalamic-reticular and thalamocortical mechanisms and could represent a biological marker of illness.},

abstract = {Despite advances in neuroimaging techniques over the past three decades that have helped in identifying structural lesions of the central nervous system, electroencephalography (EEG) continues to provide valuable insight into brain function by demonstrating focal or diffuse background abnormalities and epileptiform abnormalities. It is an extremely valuable test in patients suspected of epilepsy and in patients with altered mental status and coma. Patterns in the EEG make it possible to clarify the seizure type; it is indispensable for the diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus and for separating epileptic from other paroxysmal (nonepileptic) episodes. There are EEG patterns predictive of the cause of the encephalopathy (i.e., triphasic waves in metabolic encephalopathy) or the location of the lesion (i.e., focal polymorphic delta activity in lesions of the subcortical white matter). The various EEG characteristics of infantile, childhood, and adult epilepsies are described as well as the EEG patterns that are morphologically similar to interictal/ictal epileptiform discharges but unrelated to epilepsy. An EEG is most helpful in determining the severity and, hence, the prognosis of cerebral dysfunction. Lastly, EEG is extremely helpful in assessing normal or abnormal brain functioning in a newborn because of the serious limitation in performing an adequate neurologic examination on the neonate who is intubated or paralyzed for ventilatory control. Under such circumstances, the EEG may be the only available tool to detect an encephalopathic process or the occurrence of epileptic seizures.},

abstract = {An EEG-based brain-computer system can be used to control external devices such as computers, wheelchairs or Virtual Environments. One of the most important applications is a spelling device to aid severely disabled individuals with communication, for example people disabled by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). P300-based BCI systems are optimal for spelling characters with high speed and accuracy, as compared to other BCI paradigms such as motor imagery. In this study, 100 subjects tested a P300-based BCI system to spell a 5-character word with only 5 min of training. EEG data were acquired while the subject looked at a 36-character matrix to spell the word WATER. Two different versions of the P300 speller were used: (i) the row/column speller (RC) that flashes an entire column or row of characters and (ii) a single character speller (SC) that flashes each character individually. The subjects were free to decide which version to test. Nineteen subjects opted to test both versions. The BCI system classifier was trained on the data collected for the word WATER. During the real-time phase of the experiment, the subject spelled the word LUCAS, and was provided with the classifier selection accuracy after each of the five letters. Additionally, subjects filled out a questionnaire about age, sex, education, sleep duration, working duration, cigarette consumption, coffee consumption, and level of disturbance that the flashing characters produced. 72.8{\%} (N = 81) of the subjects were able to spell with 100{\%} accuracy in the RC paradigm and 55.3{\%} (N = 38) of the subjects spelled with 100{\%} accuracy in the SC paradigm. Less than 3{\%} of the subjects did not spell any character correctly. People who slept less than 8 h performed significantly better than other subjects. Sex, education, working duration, and cigarette and coffee consumption were not statistically related to differences in accuracy. The disturbance of the flashing characters was rated with a median score of 1 on a scale from 1 to 5 (1, not disturbing; 5, highly disturbing). This study shows that high spelling accuracy can be achieved with the P300 BCI system using approximately 5 min of training data for a large number of non-disabled subjects, and that the RC paradigm is superior to the SC paradigm. 89{\%} of the 81 RC subjects were able to spell with accuracy 80-100{\%}. A similar study using a motor imagery BCI with 99 subjects showed that only 19{\%} of the subjects were able to achieve accuracy of 80-100{\%}. These large differences in accuracy suggest that with limited amounts of training data the P300-based BCI is superior to the motor imagery BCI. Overall, these results are very encouraging and a similar study should be conducted with subjects who have ALS to determine if their accuracy levels are similar. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {EEGs of the frontal brain of patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) have been investigated in recent years using linear methods but not based on nonlinear methods. This paper presents an investigation of the frontal brain of MDD patients using the wavelet-chaos methodology and Katz's and Higuchi's fractal dimensions (KFD and HFD) as measures of nonlinearity and complexity. EEGs of the frontal brain of healthy adults and MDD patients are decomposed into 5 EEG sub-bands employing a wavelet filter bank, and the FDs of the band-limited as well as those of their 5 sub-bands are computed. Then, using the ANOVA statistical test, HFDs and KFDs of the left and right frontal lobes in EEG full-band and sub-bands of MDD and healthy groups are compared in order to discover the FDs showing the most meaningful differences between the two groups. Finally, the discovered FDs are used as input to a classifier, enhanced probabilistic neural network (EPNN), to discriminate the MDD from healthy EEGs. The results of HFD show higher complexity of left, right and overall frontal lobes of the brain of MDD compared with non-MDD in beta and gamma sub-bands. Moreover, it is observed that HFD of the beta band is more discriminative than HFD of the gamma band for discriminating MDD and non-MDD participants, while the KFD did not show any meaningful difference. A high accuracy of 91.3{\%} is achieved for classification of MDD and non-MDD EEGs based on HFDs of left, right, and overall frontal brain beta sub-band. The findings of this research, however, should be considered tentative because of limited data available to the authors. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Such findings, highlighted in this review, suggest that frontal EEG asymmetry may serve as both a moderator and a mediator of emotion- and motivation-related constructs. Unequivocal evidence supporting frontal EEG asymmetry as a moderator and/or mediator of emotion is lacking, as insufficient attention has been given to analyzing the frontal EEG asymmetries in terms of moderators and mediators. The present report reviews the frontal EEG asymmetry literature from the framework of moderators and mediators, and overviews data analytic strategies that would support claims of moderation and mediation. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The time-frequency content of the EEG signals is extracted using the Short Time Fourier Transform. The analysis focuses on the EEG energy distribution among the well-established delta, theta and alpha rhythms (2-13 Hz), as energy variations in these frequency bands are widely associated with seizure activity. Relying on seizure rhythmicity, the classification is performed by isolating the segments where each rhythm is more clearly and dominantly expressed over the others. For the first time, an unsupervised methodology is evaluated using more than 978 hours of EEG recordings from a public database. The results show that the proposed methodology achieves high seizure detection sensitivity with significantly reduced human intervention.},

abstract = {Electrophysiological recordings are considered a reliable method of assessing a person's alertness. Sleep medicine is asked to offer objective methods to measure daytime alertness, tiredness and sleepiness. As EEG signals are non-stationary, the conventional method of frequency analysis is not highly successful in recognition of alertness level. This paper deals with a novel method of analysis of EEG signals using wavelet transform, and classification using ANN. EEG signals were decomposed into the frequency sub-bands using wavelet transform and a set of statistical features was extracted from the sub-bands to represent the distribution of wavelet coefficients. Then these statistical features were used as an input to an ANN with three discrete outputs: alert, drowsy and sleep. The error back-propagation neural network is selected as a classifier to discriminate the alertness level of a subject. EEG signals were obtained from 30 healthy subjects. The group consisted of 14 females and 16 males with ages ranging from 18 to 65 years and a mean age of 33.5 years, and a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32.4??7.3 kg/m2. Alertness level and classification properties of ANN were tested using the data recorded in 12 healthy subjects, whereby the EEG recordings were not used to train the ANN. The statistics were used as a measure of potential applicability of the ANN. The accuracy of the ANN was 95??3{\%} alert, 93??4{\%} drowsy and 92??5{\%} sleep. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Driven by the multi-level structure of human intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings of epileptic seizures, we introduce a new variant of a hierarchical Dirichlet Process---the multi-level clustering hierarchical Dirichlet Process (MLC-HDP)---that simultaneously clusters datasets on multiple levels. Our seizure dataset contains brain activity recorded in typically more than a hundred individual channels for each seizure of each patient. The MLC-HDP model clusters over channels-types, seizure-types, and patient-types simultaneously. We describe this model and its implementation in detail. We also present the results of a simulation study comparing the MLC-HDP to a similar model, the Nested Dirichlet Process and finally demonstrate the MLC-HDP's use in modeling seizures across multiple patients. We find the MLC-HDP's clustering to be comparable to independent human physician clusterings. To our knowledge, the MLC-HDP model is the first in the epilepsy literature capable of clustering seizures within and between patients.},

abstract = {The use of EEG biometrics, for the purpose of automatic people recognition, has received increasing attention in the recent years. Most of current analysis rely on the extraction of features characterizing the activity of single brain regions, like power-spectrum estimates, thus neglecting possible temporal dependencies between the generated EEG signals. However, important physiological information can be extracted from the way different brain regions are functionally coupled. In this study, we propose a novel approach that fuses spectral coherencebased connectivity between different brain regions as a possibly viable biometric feature. The proposed approach is tested on a large dataset of subjects (N=108) during eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting state conditions. The obtained recognition performances show that using brain connectivity leads to higher distinctiveness with respect to power-spectrum measurements, in both the experimental conditions. Notably, a 100{\%} recognition accuracy is obtained in EC and EO when integrating functional connectivity between regions in the frontal lobe, while a lower 97.5{\%} is obtained in EC (96.26{\%} in EO) when fusing power spectrum information from parieto-occipital (centro-parietal in EO) regions. Taken together, these results suggest that functional connectivity patterns represent effective features for improving EEG-based biometric systems.},

First, we use continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics to select the active segment in the time-frequency domain. The multiresolution fractal features are then extracted from wavelet data by means of modified fractal dimension. At last, CHNN clustering is adopted to recognize extracted features. Due to the characteristic of non-supervision, it is proper for CHNN to classify non-stationary EEG signals. The results indicate that CHNN achieves 81.9{\%} in average classification accuracy in comparison with self-organizing map (SOM) and several popular supervised classifiers on six subjects from two data sets.},

There are powerful methods from machine learning and signal processing that permit the optimization of spatio-temporal filters for each subject in a data dependent fashion beyond the fixed filters based on the sensor geometry, e.g., Laplacians. Here we elucidate the theoretical background of the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, a popular method in brain-computer interface (BCD research.

METHODS: A new algorithm called Matching Pursuit was used for the decomposition of sleep EEG into waveforms chosen from a large and redundant set of functions. As a result all signal structures were parameterized in terms of their frequency, time occurrence, time span and energy. Slow wave activity and sleep spindles were identified according to neurophysiological criteria and various distributions describing their time evolution, topographical and frequency characteristics were constructed. RESULTS: Two types of sleep spindles of different topological and spectral properties were identified. High time-frequency resolution made possible separation of superimposed spindles. Cross-correlation between high- and low-frequency components of superimposed spindles revealed a fixed time-delay between them, the high-frequency component preceding the low-frequency one. CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that processes of generation of both types of sleep spindles are weakly coupled.},

abstract = {We propose a unified approach to automatic foreign accent recognition. It takes advantage of recent technology advances in both linguistics and acoustics based modeling techniques in automatic speech recognition (ASR) while overcoming the issue of a lack of a large set of transcribed data often required in designing state-of-the-art ASR systems. The key idea lies in defining a common set of fundamental units “universally” across all spoken accents such that any given spoken utterance can be transcribed with this set of “accent-universal” units. In this study, we adopt a set of units describing manner and place of articulation as speech attributes. These units exist in most spoken languages and they can be reliably modeled and extracted to represent foreign accent cues. We also propose an i-vector representation strategy to model the feature streams formed by concatenating these units. Testing on both the Finnish national foreign language certificate (FSD) corpus and the English NIST 2008 SRE corpus, the experimental results with the proposed approach demonstrate a significant system performance improvement with p-value over those with the conventional spectrum-based techniques. We observed up to a 15{\%} relative error reduction over the already very strong i-vector accented recognition system when only manner information is used. Additional improvement is obtained by adding place of articulation clues along with context information. Furthermore, diagnostic information provided by the proposed approach can be useful to the designers to further enhance the system performance.},

Unfortunately, MoBI protocols are prone to physiological and non-physiological artifacts, including motion artifacts that may contaminate the EEG recordings. A few attempts have been made to quantify these artifacts during locomotion tasks but with inconclusive results due in part to methodological pitfalls. In this paper, we investigate the potential contributions of motion artifacts in scalp EEG during treadmill walking at three different speeds (1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 km/h) using a wireless 64 channel active EEG system and a wireless inertial sensor attached to the subject's head. The experimental setup was designed according to good measurement practices using state-of-the-art commercially available instruments, and the measurements were analyzed using Fourier analysis and wavelet coherence approaches. Contrary to prior claims, the subjects' motion did not significantly affect their EEG during treadmill walking although precaution should be taken when gait speeds approach 4.5 km/h. Overall, these findings suggest how MoBI methods may be safely deployed in neural, cognitive, and rehabilitation engineering applications.},

This paper describes the work of the AASM Visual Scoring Task Force, including methodology, a literature review and the rationale behind the new rules. Reliability studies of R {\&} K scoring were reviewed; reliability was low for stage one and moderate for slow wave sleep. Evidence indicated that K complexes and slow waves are expressed maximal frontally, spindles centrally and alpha rhythm over the occipital region. Three derivations of EEG, two of electro-oculography, and one of chin EMG were recommended. Scoring by 30-second epochs was retained. New terminology for sleep stages was proposed. Attenuation of alpha rhythm was determined to be the most valid electrophysiological marker of sleep onset. Alternative measures were proposed for non-alpha generating subjects. K complexes associated with arousals were determined to be insufficient alone to define the new stage N2. No evidence was found to justify dividing slow wave sleep into two stages. No reasons were found to alter the current slow wave amplitude criteria at any age. The phenomena of REM sleep were defined. The rules for defining onset and termination of REM sleep periods were simplified. Movement time was eliminated and major body movements defined. Studies are needed to test the reliability of the new rules. Future advances in technology may require modification of these rules with time.},

abstract = {Objective: When EEG is recorded in humans, the question arises whether the resting EEG remains stable. We compared the inter-individual variation in spectral observables to the intra-individual stability over more than a year. Methods: We recorded resting EEG in 55 healthy adults with eyes closed. In 20 persons EEG was recorded in a second session with retest intervals 12-40 months. For electrodes AFz, Cz and Pz ?? peak frequency and ?? peak height were transformed into Z-scores. We compared the curve shape of power spectra by first aligning ?? peaks to 10 Hz and then regressing spectra pairwise onto each other to calculate a t-value. The t-value and differences of Z-scores for all pairs of sessions were entered into a generalized linear model (GLM) where binary output represents the recognition probability. The results were cross-validated by out-of-sample testing. Results: Of the 40 sessions, 35 were correctly matched. The shape of power spectra contributed most to recognition. Out of all 2960 pairwise comparisons 99.5{\%} were correct, with sensitivity 88{\%} and specificity 99.5{\%}. Conclusions: Our statistical apparatus allows to identify those spectral EEG observables which qualify as statistical signature of a person. Significance: The effect of external factors on EEG observables can be contrasted against their normal variability over time. ?? 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

The search to identify the dynamic connectivity of brain signals within different frequency bands, in order to uncover the transient cooperation between different brain sites, converges at the potential of multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) models and their derived parameters. In fact, MVAR parameters provide a whole battery of so-called coupling measures including classic coherence (COH), partial coherence (pCOH), imaginary part of coherence (iCOH), partial-directed coherence (PDC), directed transfer function (DTF), and full frequency directed transfer function (ffDTF). All of these approaches have been developed to quantify the degree of coupling between different EEG recording positions, with the specific aim to characterize the functional interaction between neural populations within the cortex. This work addresses the application of MVAR models to event-related brain processes, including different statistical approaches, and reviews most relevant findings in the expanding field of coupling analysis. Finally, we present several examples of coupling patterns associated with certain types of movement imagery. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The human brain continually generates electrical potentials representing neural communication. These potentials can be measured at the scalp, and constitute the electroencephalogram (EEG). When the EEG is time-locked to stimulation - such as the presentation of a word - and averaged over many such presentations, the Event-Related Potential (ERP) is obtained. The functional characteristics of components of the ERP are well understood, and some components represent processing that may differ uniquely from individual to individual-such as the N400 component, which represents access to the semantic network. We applied several pattern classifiers to ERPs representing the response of individuals to a stream of text designed to be idiosyncratically familiar to different individuals. Results indicate that there are robustly identifiable features of the ERP that enable labeling of ERPs as belonging to individuals with accuracy reliably above chance (in the range of 82-97{\%}). Further, these features are stable over time, as indicated by continued accurate identification of individuals from ERPs after a lag of up to six months. Even better, the high degree of labeling accuracy achieved in all cases was achieved with the use of only 3 electrodes on the scalp-the minimal possible number that can acquire clean data.},

Increasingly, these oscillations are of biological and clinical interest because of their role in development, learning and neurological disorders. We used an Internet interface to crowdsource spindle identification by human experts and non-experts, and we compared their performance with that of automated detection algorithms in data from middle- to older-aged subjects from the general population. We also refined methods for forming group consensus and evaluating the performance of event detectors in physiological data such as electroencephalographic recordings from polysomnography. Compared to the expert group consensus gold standard, the highest performance was by individual experts and the non-expert group consensus, followed by automated spindle detectors. This analysis showed that crowdsourcing the scoring of sleep data is an efficient method to collect large data sets, even for difficult tasks such as spindle identification. Further refinements to spindle detection algorithms are needed for middle- to older-aged subjects.},

abstract = {Objective: EEG is widely used to predict outcome in comatose cardiac arrest patients, but its value has been limited by lack of a uniform classification. We used the EEG terminology proposed by the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) to assess interrater variability in a cohort of cardiac arrest patients included in the Target Temperature Management trial. The main objective was to evaluate if malignant EEG-patterns could reliably be identified. Methods: Full-length EEGs from 103 comatose cardiac arrest patients were interpreted by four EEG-specialists with different nationalities who were blinded for patient outcome. Percent agreement and kappa ($\kappa$) for the categories in the ACNS EEG terminology and for prespecified malignant EEG-patterns were calculated. Results: There was substantial interrater agreement ($\kappa$ 0.71) for highly malignant patterns and moderate agreement ($\kappa$ 0.42) for malignant patterns. Substantial agreement was found for malignant periodic or rhythmic patterns ($\kappa$ 0.72) while agreement for identifying an unreactive EEG was fair ($\kappa$ 0.26). Conclusions: The ACNS EEG terminology can be used to identify highly malignant EEG-patterns in post cardiac arrest patients in an international context with high reliability. Significance: The establishment of strict criteria with high transferability between interpreters will increase the usefulness of routine EEG to assess neurological prognosis after cardiac arrest.},

abstract = {In many data analysis tasks, one is often confronted with very high dimensional data. Feature selection techniques are designed to find the relevant feature subset of the original features which can facilitate clustering, classification and re- trieval. In this paper, we consider the feature selection prob- lem in unsupervised learning scenario, which is particularly difficult due to the absence of class labels that would guide the search for relevant information. The feature selection problem is essentially a combinatorial optimization problem which is computationally expensive. Traditional unsuper- vised feature selection methods address this issue by select- ing the top ranked features based on certain scores com- puted independently for each feature. These approaches ne- glect the possible correlation between different features and thus can not produce an optimal feature subset. Inspired from the recent developments on manifold learning and L1- regularized models for subset selection, we propose in this paper a new approach, called Multi-Cluster Feature Selection (MCFS), for unsupervised feature selection. Specifically, we select those features such that the multi-cluster structure of the data can be best preserved. The corresponding op- timization problem can be efficiently solved since it only involves a sparse eigen-problem and a L1-regularized least squares problem.

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre- lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna- tional conference, ∗∗∗, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression. Keywords:},

The proposed system is evaluated with images of lines of text from the IAM Handwriting Database, and compared with more traditional approaches. The authors also analyse several algorithms for the detection and extraction of points of interest in the text images, different parameters for the modelling part and different scoring techniques.

Given this situation, we would expect that there should be observable and perhaps major changes in electrocortical activity and responses. In this review, we discuss developmental reductions in EEG power and alterations in the dominant band of EEG oscillation frequency, moderated by developmental factors such as growth-related changes in grey and white matter, and in the developmental history of cognitive and sociocultural stressors. Similarly, we summarize alterations in event-related potential components reflecting stimulus processing, response monitoring, and response anticipation.

abstract = {The accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification depends significantly on the metric used to compute distances between different examples. In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classification from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classification using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program. On several data sets of varying size and difficulty, we find that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements in kNN classification. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner.},

We study how to select good features according to the maximal statistical dependency criterion based on mutual information. Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e. g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.},

abstract = {Evidence supports the robustness and stability of individual differences in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) spectra with a special emphasis on the 9-16 Hz range corresponding to sleep spindle activity. These differences cast doubt on the universal validity of sleep spindle analysis methods based on strict amplitude and frequency criteria or a set of templates of natural spindles. We aim to improve sleep spindle analysis by the individual adjustments of frequency and amplitude criteria, the use of a minimum set of a priori knowledge, and by clear dissections of slow- and fast sleep spindles as well as to transcend the concept of visual inspection as being the ultimate test of the method's validity. We defined spindles as those segments of the NREM sleep EEG which contribute to the two peak regions within the 9-16 Hz EEG spectra. These segments behaved as slow- and fast sleep spindles in terms of topography and sleep cycle effects, while age correlated negatively with the occurrence of fast type events only. Automatic detections covered 92.9{\%} of visual spindle detections (A{\&}VD). More than half of the automatic detections (58.41{\%}) were exclusively automatic detections (EADs). The spectra of EAD correlated significantly and positively with the spectra of A{\&}VD as well as with the average (AVG) spectra. However, both EAD and A{\&}VD had higher individual-specific spindle spectra than AVG had. Results suggest that the individual adjustment method (IAM) detects EEG segments possessing the individual-specific spindle spectra with higher sensitivity than visual scoring does. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Brain-Computer Interfaces can suffer from a large variance of the subject conditions within and across sessions. For example vigilance ﬂuctuations in the individual, variable task involvement, workload etc. alter the characteristics of EEG signals and thus challenge a stable BCI operation. In the present work we aim to deﬁne features based on a variant of the common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm that are constructed invariant with respect to such nonstationarities. We enforce invariance properties by adding terms to the denominator of a Rayleigh coefﬁcient representation of CSP such as disturbance covariance matrices from ﬂuctuations in visual processing. In this manner physiological prior knowledge can be used to shape the classiﬁcation engine for BCI. As a proof of concept we present a BCI classiﬁer that is robust to changes in the level of parietal $\alpha$-activity. In other words, the EEG decoding still works when there are lapses in vigilance.},

abstract = {There is a step of significant difficulty experienced by brain-computer interface (BCI) users when going from the calibration recording to the feedback application. This effect has been previously studied and a supervised adaptation solution has been proposed. In this paper, we suggest a simple unsupervised adaptation method of the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier that effectively solves this problem by counteracting the harmful effect of nonclass-related nonstationarities in electroencephalography (EEG) during BCI sessions performed with motor imagery tasks. For this, we first introduce three types of adaptation procedures and investigate them in an offline study with 19 datasets. Then, we select one of the proposed methods and analyze it further. The chosen classifier is offline tested in data from 80 healthy users and four high spinal cord injury patients. Finally, for the first time in BCI literature, we apply this unsupervised classifier in online experiments. Additionally, we show that its performance is significantly better than the state-of-the-art supervised approach.},

abstract = {A novel neural information processing architecture inspired by quantum mechanics and incorporating the well-known Schrodinger wave equation is proposed in this paper. The proposed architecture referred to as recurrent quantum neural network (RQNN) can characterize a nonstationary stochastic signal as time-varying wave packets. A robust unsupervised learning algorithm enables the RQNN to effectively capture the statistical behavior of the input signal and facilitates the estimation of signal embedded in noise with unknown characteristics. The results from a number of benchmark tests show that simple signals such as dc, staircase dc, and sinusoidal signals embedded within high noise can be accurately filtered and particle swarm optimization can be employed to select model parameters. The RQNN filtering procedure is applied in a two-class motor imagery-based brain-computer interface where the objective was to filter electroencephalogram (EEG) signals before feature extraction and classification to increase signal separability. A two-step inner-outer fivefold cross-validation approach is utilized to select the algorithm parameters subject-specifically for nine subjects. It is shown that the subject-specific RQNN EEG filtering significantly improves brain-computer interface performance compared to using only the raw EEG or Savitzky-Golay filtered EEG across multiple sessions.},

abstract = {The study of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has undergone 30 years of intense development and has grown into a rich and diverse field. BCIs are technologies that enable direct communication between the human brain and external devices. Conventionally, wet electrodes have been employed to obtain unprecedented sensitivity to high-temporal-resolution brain activity; recently, the growing availability of various sensors that can be used to detect high-quality brain signals in a wide range of clinical and everyday environments is being exploited. This development of biosensing neurotechnologies and the desire to implement them in real-world applications have led to the opportunity to develop augmented BCIs (ABCIs) in the upcoming decades. An ABCI is similar to a BCI in that it relies on biosensors that record signals from the brain in everyday environments; the signals are then processed in real time to monitor the behavior of the human. To use an ABCI as a mobile brain imaging technique for everyday, real-life applications, the sensors and the corresponding device must be lightweight and the equipment response time must be short. This study presents an overview of the wide range of biosensor approaches currently being applied to ABCIs, from their use in the laboratory to their application in clinical and everyday use. The basic principles of each technique are described along with examples of current applications of cutting-edge neuroscience research. In summary, we show that ABCI techniques continue to grow and evolve, incorporating new technologies and advances to address ever more complex and important neuroscience issues, with advancements that are envisioned to lead to a wide range of real-life applications.},

abstract = {Eye movements, eye blinks, cardiac signals, muscle noise, and line noise present serious problems for electroencephalographic (EEG) interpretation and analysis when rejecting contaminated EEG segments results in an unacceptable data loss. Many methods have been proposed to remove artifacts from EEG recordings, especially those arising from eye movements and blinks. Often regression in the time or frequency domain is performed on parallel EEG and electrooculographic (EOG) recordings to derive parameters characterizing the appearance and spread of EOG artifacts in the EEG channels. Because EEG and ocular activity mix bidirectionally, regressing out eye artifacts inevitably involves subtracting relevant EEG signals from each record as well. Regression methods become even more problematic when a good regressing channel is not available for each artifact source, as in the case of muscle artifacts. Use of principal component analysis (PCA) has been proposed to remove eye artifacts from multichannel EEG. However, PCA cannot completely separate eye artifacts from brain signals, especially when they have comparable amplitudes. Here, we propose a new and generally applicable method for removing a wide variety of artifacts from EEG records based on blind source separation by independent component analysis (ICA). Our results on EEG data collected from normal and autistic subjects show that ICA can effectively detect, separate, and remove contamination from a wide variety of artifactual sources in EEG records with results comparing favorably with those obtained using regression and PCA methods. ICA can also be used to analyze blink-related brain activity.},

abstract = {One of the most popular feature extraction algorithms for brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is common spatial patterns (CSPs). Despite its known efficiency and widespread use, CSP is also known to be very sensitive to noise and prone to overfitting. To address this issue, it has been recently proposed to regularize CSP. In this paper, we present a simple and unifying theoretical framework to design such a regularized CSP (RCSP). We then present a review of existing RCSP algorithms and describe how to cast them in this framework. We also propose four new RCSP algorithms. Finally, we compare the performances of 11 different RCSP (including the four new ones and the original CSP), on electroencephalography data from 17 subjects, from BCI competition datasets. Results showed that the best RCSP methods can outperform CSP by nearly 10{\%} in median classification accuracy and lead to more neurophysiologically relevant spatial filters. They also enable us to perform efficient subject-to-subject transfer. Overall, the best RCSP algorithms were CSP with Tikhonov regularization and weighted Tikhonov regularization, both proposed in this paper.},

It shows a new formula that connects the input-output mutual information and the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) achievable by optimal estimation of the input given the output. That is, the derivative of the mutual information (nats) with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is equal to half the MMSE, regardless of the input statistics. This relationship holds for both scalar and vector signals, as well as for discrete-time and continuous-time noncausal MMSE estimation. This fundamental information-theoretic result has an unexpected consequence in continuous-time nonlinear estimation: For any input signal with finite power, the causal filtering MMSE achieved at SNR is equal to the average value of the noncausal smoothing MMSE achieved with a channel whose signal-to-noise ratio is chosen uniformly distributed between 0 and SNR.},

abstract = {Background People with chronic tetraplegia, due to high-cervical spinal cord injury, can regain limb movements through coordinated electrical stimulation of peripheral muscles and nerves, known as functional electrical stimulation (FES). Users typically command FES systems through other preserved, but unrelated and limited in number, volitional movements (eg, facial muscle activity, head movements, shoulder shrugs). We report the findings of an individual with traumatic high-cervical spinal cord injury who coordinated reaching and grasping movements using his own paralysed arm and hand, reanimated through implanted FES, and commanded using his own cortical signals through an intracortical brain–computer interface (iBCI). Methods We recruited a participant into the BrainGate2 clinical trial, an ongoing study that obtains safety information regarding an intracortical neural interface device, and investigates the feasibility of people with tetraplegia controlling assistive devices using their cortical signals. Surgical procedures were performed at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center (Cleveland, OH, USA). Study procedures and data analyses were performed at Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH, USA) and the US Department of Veterans Affairs, Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Cleveland, OH, USA). The study participant was a 53-year-old man with a spinal cord injury (cervical level 4, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale category A). He received two intracortical microelectrode arrays in the hand area of his motor cortex, and 4 months and 9 months later received a total of 36 implanted percutaneous electrodes in his right upper and lower arm to electrically stimulate his hand, elbow, and shoulder muscles. The participant used a motorised mobile arm support for gravitational assistance and to provide humeral abduction and adduction under cortical control. We assessed the participant's ability to cortically command his paralysed arm to perform simple single-joint arm and hand movements and functionally meaningful multi-joint movements. We compared iBCI control of his paralysed arm with that of a virtual three-dimensional arm. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00912041. Findings The intracortical implant occurred on Dec 1, 2014, and we are continuing to study the participant. The last session included in this report was Nov 7, 2016. The point-to-point target acquisition sessions began on Oct 8, 2015 (311 days after implant). The participant successfully cortically commanded single-joint and coordinated multi-joint arm movements for point-to-point target acquisitions (80–100{\%} accuracy), using first a virtual arm and second his own arm animated by FES. Using his paralysed arm, the participant volitionally performed self-paced reaches to drink a mug of coffee (successfully completing 11 of 12 attempts within a single session 463 days after implant) and feed himself (717 days after implant). Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first report of a combined implanted FES+iBCI neuroprosthesis for restoring both reaching and grasping movements to people with chronic tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury, and represents a major advance, with a clear translational path, for clinically viable neuroprostheses for restoration of reaching and grasping after paralysis.

Our method gathers two common approaches to tackle the multi-class problem: 1) the supervised approach of Common Spatial Patterns and Sparse and/or Spectral variants (CSP, CSSP, CSSSP) to discriminate between different tasks; 2) the criterion of statistical independence of non-stationary sources used in Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Our method can exploit different properties of the signals to find the best discriminative linear combinations of sensors. This yields different models of separation. This work aims at comparing these models. Whereas instantaneous mixing models are usually considered for such an application, we observe that a convolutive mixing model, in which separation is done independently in different frequency bands, gives the best results.},

Enrolling a target speaker consists in calculating the posterior distribution of the hidden variables in the factor analysis model and verification tests are conducted using a new type of likelihood II ratio statistic. Using the NIST 1999 and 2000 speaker recognition evaluation data sets, we show that the effectiveness of this approach depends on the availability of a training corpus which is well matched with the evaluation set used for testing. Experiments on the NIST 1999 evaluation set using a mismatched corpus to train factor analysis models did not result in any improvement over standard methods, but we found that, even with this type of mismatch, feature warping performs extremely well in conjunction with the factor analysis model, and this enabled us to obtain very good results (equal error rates of about 6.2{\%})},

abstract = {In this paper, we show how ElectroEncephaloGraphic (EEG) and MagnetoEncephaloGraphic (MEG) data can be analyzed statistically using nonparametric techniques. Nonparametric statistical tests offer complete freedom to the user with respect to the test statistic by means of which the experimental conditions are compared. This freedom provides a straightforward way to solve the multiple comparisons problem (MCP) and it allows to incorporate biophysically motivated constraints in the test statistic, which may drastically increase the sensitivity of the statistical test. The paper is written for two audiences: (1) empirical neuroscientists looking for the most appropriate data analysis method, and (2) methodologists interested in the theoretical concepts behind nonparametric statistical tests. For the empirical neuroscientist, a large part of the paper is written in a tutorial-like fashion, enabling neuroscientists to construct their own statistical test, maximizing the sensitivity to the expected effect. And for the methodologist, it is explained why the nonparametric test is formally correct. This means that we formulate a null hypothesis (identical probability distribution in the different experimental conditions) and show that the nonparametric test controls the false alarm rate under this null hypothesis. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Automatic recognition of these types of information in adults' speech has received considerable attention, however there has been little work on children's speech. This paper focuses on speaker, gender, and age-group recognition from children's speech. The performances of several classification methods are compared, including Gaussian Mixture Model–Universal Background Model (GMM–UBM), GMM–Support Vector Machine (GMM–SVM) and i-vector based approaches. For speaker recognition, error rate decreases as age increases, as one might expect. However for gender and age-group recognition the effect of age is more complex due mainly to consequences of the onset of puberty. Finally, the utility of different frequency bands for speaker, age-group and gender recognition from children's speech is assessed.},

abstract = {This work explores the sensitivity of electroencephalographic-based biometric recognition to the type of tasks required by subjects to perform while their brain activity is being recorded. A novel wavelet-based feature is used to extract identity information from a database of 109 subjects who performed four different motor movement/imagery tasks while their data were recorded. Training and test of the system was performed using a number of experimental protocols to establish if training with one type of task and tested with another would significantly affect the recognition performance. Also, experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance when a mixture of data from different tasks was used for training. The results suggest that performance is not significantly affected when there is a mismatch between training and test tasks. Furthermore, as the amount of data used for training is increased using a combination of data from several tasks, the performance can be improved. These results indicate that a more flexible approach may be incorporated in data collection for EEG-based biometric systems which could facilitate their deployment and improved performance.},

The design of EEG representations and classifiers for BCI are open research questions whose difficulty stems from the need to extract complex spatial and temporal patterns from noisy multidimensional time series obtained from EEG measurements. The high-dimensional and noisy nature of EEG may limit the advantage of nonlinear classification methods over linear ones. This paper reports the results of a linear (linear discriminant analysis) and two nonlinear classifiers (neural networks and support vector machines) applied to the classification of spontaneous EEG during five mental tasks, showing that nonlinear classifiers produce only slightly better classification results. An approach to feature selection based on genetic algorithms is also presented with preliminary results of application to EEG during finger movement.},

abstract = {This paper presents an extension of our previous work which proposes a new speaker representation for speaker verification. In this modeling, a new low-dimensional speaker- and channel-dependent space is defined using a simple factor analysis. This space is named the total variability space because it models both speaker and channel variabilities. Two speaker verification systems are proposed which use this new representation. The first system is a support vector machine-based system that uses the cosine kernel to estimate the similarity between the input data. The second system directly uses the cosine similarity as the final decision score. We tested three channel compensation techniques in the total variability space, which are within-class covariance normalization (WCCN), linear discriminate analysis (LDA), and nuisance attribute projection (NAP). We found that the best results are obtained when LDA is followed by WCCN. We achieved an equal error rate (EER) of 1.12{\%} and MinDCF of 0.0094 using the cosine distance scoring on the male English trials of the core condition of the NIST 2008 Speaker Recognition Evaluation dataset. We also obtained 4{\%} absolute EER improvement for both-gender trials on the 10 s-10 s condition compared to the classical joint factor analysis scoring.},

In particular, we propose several advances in the feature extraction and classification stages. This is achieved by performing spatial data/sensor fusion, whereby the component relevance is investigated by selecting maximum informative (EEG) electrodes (channels) selected by Davies-Bouldin index. For convenience and ease of cognitive processing, in the experiments, simple black and white drawings of common objects are used as visual stimuli. In the classification stage, the Elman neural network is employed to classify the generated EEG energy features. Simulations are conducted by using the hold-out classification strategy on an ensemble of 1,600 raw EEG signals, and 35 maximum informative channels achieved the maximum recognition rate of 98.56∈±∈1.87{\%}. Overall, this study indicates the enormous potential of the EEG biometrics, especially due to its robustness against fraud. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Any biometric recognizer is vulnerable to spoofing attacks and hence voice biometric, also called automatic speaker verification (ASV), is no exception; replay, synthesis and conver- sion attacks all provoke false acceptances unless countermeasures are used. We focus on voice conversion (VC) attacks considered as one of the most challenging for modern recognition systems. To detect spoofing, most existing countermeasures assume explicit or implicit knowledge of a particular VC system and focus on designing discriminative features. In this work, we explore back- end generative models for more generalized countermeasures. Specifically, we model synthesis-channel subspace to perform speaker verification and anti-spoofing jointly in the i-vector space, which is a well-established technique for speaker modeling. It enables us to integrate speaker verification and anti-spoofing tasks into one system without any fusion techniques. To validate the proposed approach, we study vocoder-matched and vocoder- mismatched ASV and VC spoofing detection on the NIST 2006 speaker recognition evaluation dataset. Promising results are obtained for standalone countermeasures as well as their combination with ASV systems using score fusion and joint approach.},

abstract = {Multifractal theory provides an elegant statistical characterization of many complex dynamical variations in Nature and engineering. It is conceivable that it may enrich characterization of the sun's magnetic activity and its dynamical modeling. Recently, on applying Fourier truncation to remove the 11-year cycle and carrying out multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis of the filtered sunspot time series, Movahed et al reported that sunspot data are characterized by multifractal scaling laws with the exponent for the second-order moment, h(2), being 1.12. Moreover, they think the filtered sunspot data are like afractional Brownian motion process with anti-persistent long-range correlations characterized by the Hurst parameter H = h(2) − 1= 0.12. By designing an adaptive detrending algorithm and critically assessing the effectiveness of Fourier truncation in eliminating the 11-year cycle, we show that the values of the fractal scaling exponents obtained by Movahed et al are artifacts of the filtering algorithm that they used. Instead, sunspot data with the 11-year cycle properly filtered are characterized by a different type of multifractal with persistent long- range correlations characterized by H ≈ 0.74.},

The detection paradigm was tested on a constant 8 channel subset of 18 channel scalp EEG recordings. The NN was trained to recognize seizures using 98 training examples. A strategy was devised using wavelet transform to construct a filter that was 'matched' to the frequency features of examples used to train the NN. Four second epochs of training examples and EEGs being tested were transformed into time-independent representations of spectrograms resulting in a time-frequency representation of the time-series. Rule-based long and short term contextual features were used for detection in association with the NN. Fifty-six seizures were detected from a possible 62 (90{\%}) associated with an average 0.71 ?? 0.79 false-positive errors per hour using the same 'population' detection parameters. When the sensitivity for detection was increased, all but one of the 62 seizures were detected (98{\%}). Less than 1.0 false-positive error per hour occurred in all but 5 records when using the 'population' parameters. The combination of rule-based detection criteria employing contextual parameters and unsupervised training of NNs to recognize time-frequency patterns is a promising direction for automated seizure detection.},

abstract = {A method of speaker adaptation for continuous density hidden Markov models (HMMs) is presented. An initial speaker-independent system is adapted to improve the modelling of a new speaker by updating the HMM parameters. Statistics are gathered from the available adaptation data and used to calculate a linear regression-based transformation for the mean vectors. The transformation matrices are calculated to maximize the likelihood of the adaptation data and can be implemented using the forward–backward algorithm. By tying the transformations among a number of distributions, adaptation can be performed for distributions which are not represented in the training data. An important feature of the method is that arbitrary adaptation data can be used—no special enrolment sentences are needed. Experiments have been performed on the ARPA RM1 database using an HMM system with cross-word triphones and mixture Gaussian output distributions. Results show that adaptation can be performed using as little as 11 s of adaptation data, and that as more data is used the adaptation performance improves. For example, using 40 adaptation utterances, a 37{\%} reduction in error from the speaker-independent system was achieved with supervised adaptation and a 32{\%} reduction in unsupervised mode.},

Pincus introduced approximate entropy (ApEn), a set of measures of system complexity closely related to entropy, which is easily applied to clinical cardiovascular and other time series. ApEn statistics, however, lead to inconsistent results. We have developed a new and related complexity measure, sample entropy (SampEn), and have compared ApEn and SampEn by using them to analyze sets of random numbers with known probabilistic character. We have also evaluated cross-ApEn and cross-SampEn, which use cardiovascular data sets to measure the similarity of two distinct time series. SampEn agreed with theory much more closely than ApEn over a broad range of conditions. The improved accuracy of SampEn statistics should make them useful in the study of experimental clinical cardiovascular and other biological time series.},

For the UBM, we describe how Bayesian adaptation can be used to derive claimant speaker mod-els, providing a structure leading to significant computational sav-ings during recognition. Experiments are conducted on the 1996 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation corpus and it is clearly shown that a system using a UBM and Bayesian adaptation of claimant models produces superior performance compared to speaker-dependent background sets or the UBM with independent claimant models. In addition, the creation and use of a telephone handset-type detector and a procedure called hnorm is also de-scribed which shows further, large improvements in verification performance, especially under the difficult mismatched handset conditions. This is believed to be the first use of applying a hand-set-type detector and explicit handset-type normalization for the speaker verification task.},

abstract = {i-Vector based recognition is a well-established technique in state-of-the-art speaker and language recognition but its use in dialect and accent classification has received less attention. In this work, we extensively experiment with the spectral feature based i-vector system on Finnish foreign accent recognition task. Parameters of the system are initially tuned with the CallFriend corpus. Then the optimized system is applied to the Finnish national foreign language certificate (FSD) corpus. The availability of suitable Finnish language corpora to estimate the hyper-parameters is necessarily limited in comparison to major languages such as English. In addition, it is not immediately clear which factors affect the foreign accent detection performance most. To this end, we assess the effect of three different components of the foreign accent recognition: (1) recognition system parameters, (2) data used for estimating hyper-parameters and (3) language aspects. We find out that training the hyper-parameters from non-matched dataset yields poor detection error rates in comparison to training from application-specific dataset. We also observed that, the mother tongue of speakers with higher proficiency in Finnish are more difficult to detect than of those speakers with lower proficiency. Analysis on age factor suggests that mother tongue detection in older speaker groups is easier than in younger speaker groups. This suggests that mother tongue traits might be more preserved in older speakers when speaking the second language in comparison to younger speakers.},

abstract = {Given a collection of similar signals that have been deformed with respect to each other, the general signal-matching problem is to recover the deformation. We formulate the problem as the minimization of an energy measure that combines a smoothness term and a similarity term. The minimization reduces to a dynamic system governed by a set of coupled, first-order differential equations. The dynamic system finds an optimal solution at a coarse scale and then tracks it continuously to a fine scale. Among the major themes in recent work on visual signal matching have been the notions of matching as constrained opti- mization, of variational surface reconstruction, and of coarse-to-fine matching. Our solution captures these in a precise, succinct, and unified form. Results are presented for one-dimensional signals, a motion sequence, and a stereo pair.},

abstract = {Audio-based video event detection (VED) on user-generated content (UGC) aims to find videos that show an observable event such as a wedding ceremony or birthday party rather than a sound, such as music, clapping or singing. The difficulty of video content analysis on UGC lies in the acoustic variability and lack of structure of the data. The UGC task has been explored mainly by computer vision, but can be benefited by the used of audio. The i-vector system is state-of-the-art in Speaker Verification, and is outperforming a conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based approach. The system compensates for undesired acoustic variability and extracts information from the acoustic environment, making it a meaningful choice for detection on UGC. This paper employs the i-vector-based system for audio-based VED on UGC and expands the understanding of the system on the task. It also includes a performance comparison with the conventional GMM-based and state-of-the-art Random Forest (RF)-based systems. The i-vector system aids audio-based event detection by addressing UGC audio characteristics. It outperforms the GMM-based system, and is competitive with the RF-based system in terms of the Missed Detection (MD) rate at 4{\%} and 2.8{\%} False Alarm (FA) rates, and complements the RF-based system by demonstrating slightly improvement in combination over the standalone systems.},

abstract = {We address the problem of acoustic source separation in a deep learning framework we call "deep clustering." Rather than directly estimating signals or masking functions, we train a deep network to produce spectrogram embeddings that are discriminative for partition labels given in training data. Previous deep network approaches provide great advantages in terms of learning power and speed, but previously it has been unclear how to use them to separate signals in a class-independent way. In contrast, spectral clustering approaches are flexible with respect to the classes and number of items to be segmented, but it has been unclear how to leverage the learning power and speed of deep networks. To obtain the best of both worlds, we use an objective function that to train embeddings that yield a low-rank approximation to an ideal pairwise affinity matrix, in a class-independent way. This avoids the high cost of spectral factorization and instead produces compact clusters that are amenable to simple clustering methods. The segmentations are therefore implicitly encoded in the embeddings, and can be "decoded" by clustering. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed method can separate speech: when trained on spectrogram features containing mixtures of two speakers, and tested on mixtures of a held-out set of speakers, it can infer masking functions that improve signal quality by around 6dB. We show that the model can generalize to three-speaker mixtures despite training only on two-speaker mixtures. The framework can be used without class labels, and therefore has the potential to be trained on a diverse set of sound types, and to generalize to novel sources. We hope that future work will lead to segmentation of arbitrary sounds, with extensions to microphone array methods as well as image segmentation and other domains.},

abstract = {Conventional brain computer interfaces rely on a guided calibration procedure to address the problem of considerable variations in electroencephalography (EEG) across human subjects. This calibration, however, implies inconvenience to the end users. In this paper, we propose an online-adaptive-learning method to address this problem for P300-based brain computer interfaces. By automatically capturing subject-specific EEG characteristics during online operation, this method allows a new user to start operating a P300-based brain-computer interface without guided (supervised) calibration. The basic principle is to first learn a generic model termed subject-independent model offline from EEG of a pool of subjects to capture common P300 characteristics. For a new user, a new model termed subject-specific model is then adapted online based on EEG recorded from the new subject and the corresponding labels predicted by either the subject-independent model or the adapted subject-specific model, depending on a confidence score. To verify the proposed method, a study involving 10 healthy subjects is carried out and positive results are obtained. For instance, after 2-4 min online adaptation (spelling of 10-20 characters), the accuracy of the adapted model converges to that of a fully trained supervised subject-specific model.},

abstract = {Classifying motion intentions in brain-computer interfacing (BCI) is a demanding task as the recorded EEG signal is not only noisy and has limited spatial resolution but it is also intrinsically non-stationary. The non-stationarities in the signal may come from many different sources, for instance, electrode artefacts, muscular activity or changes of task involvement, and often deteriorate classification performance. This is mainly because features extracted by standard methods like common spatial patterns (CSP) are not invariant to variations of the signal properties, thus should also change over time. Although many extensions of CSP were proposed to, for example, reduce the sensitivity to noise or incorporate information from other subjects, none of them tackles the non-stationarity problem directly. In this paper, we propose a method which regularizes CSP towards stationary subspaces (sCSP) and show that this increases classification accuracy, especially for subjects who are hardly able to control a BCI. We compare our method with the state-of-the-art approaches on different datasets, show competitive results and analyse the reasons for the improvement.},

abstract = {Because of increased awareness of the high prevalence of nonconvulsive seizures in critically ill patients, use of continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring is rapidly increasing in ICUs. However, cEEG monitoring is labor intensive, and manual review and interpretation of the EEG are impractical in most ICUs. Effective methods to assist in rapid and accurate detection of nonconvulsive seizures would greatly reduce the cost of cEEG monitoring and enhance the quality of patient care. In this study, we report a preliminary investigation of a novel ICU EEG analysis and seizure detection algorithm. Twenty-four prolonged cEEG recordings were included in this study. Seizure detection sensitivity and specificity were assessed for the new algorithm and for the two commercial seizure detection software systems. The new algorithm performed with a mean sensitivity of 90.4{\%} and a mean false detection rate of 0.066/hour. The two commercial detection products performed with low sensitivities (12.9 and 10.1{\%}) and false detection rates of 1.036/hour and 0.013/hour, respectively. These findings suggest that the novel algorithm has potential to be the basis of clinically useful software that can assist ICU staff in timely identification of nonconvulsive seizures. This study also suggests that currently available seizure detection software does not perform sufficiently in detection of nonconvulsive seizures in critically ill patients.

abstract = {Background:  Monitoring brain processes in real time requires genuine subsecond resolution to follow the typical timing and frequency of neural events. Non-invasive recordings of electric (EEG/ERP) and magnetic (MEG) fields provide this time resolution. They directly measure neural activations associated with a wide variety of brain states and processes, even during sleep or in infants. Mapping and source estimation can localise these time-varying activation patterns inside the brain. Methods: Recent EEG/ERP research on brain functions in the domains of attention and executive functioning, perception, memory, language, emotion and motor processing in ADHD, autism, childhood-onset schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome, specific language disorder and developmental dyslexia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and depression is reviewed. Results:  Over the past two decades, electrophysiology has substantially contributed to the understanding of brain functions during normal development, and psychiatric conditions of children and adolescents. Its time resolution has been important to measure covert processes, and to distinguish cause and effect. Conclusions:  In the future, EEG/ERP parameters will increasingly characterise the interplay of neural states and information processing. They are particularly promising tools for multilevel investigations of etiological pathways and potential predictors of clinical treatment response.},

The results show that non-linear support vector machines derives statistical models that have better prediction ability than those of radial basis function neural networks and multiple linear regression methods. This indicates that support vector machines can be used as an alternative modeling tool for quantitative structure-property/activity relationships studies.},

During the last decade they have been found useful in addressing problems in computational biology such as characterising sequence families, gene finding, structure prediction and phylogenetic analysis. In this paper we propose several measures between hidden Markov models. We give an efficient algorithm that computes the measures for left-right models, e.g. profile hidden Markov models, and briefly discuss how to extend the algorithm to other types of models. We present an experiment using the measures to compare hidden Markov models for three classes of signal peptides.},

We describe a practical procedure for applying WCCN to an SVM-based speaker recognition system where the input feature vectors reside in a high-dimensional space. Our approach involves using principal component analysis (PCA) to split the original feature space into two subspaces: a low-dimensional “PCA space ” and a high-dimensional “PCA-complement space.” After performing WCCN in the PCA space, we concatenate the resulting feature vectors with a weighted version of their PCAcomplements. When applied to a state-of-the-art MLLR-SVM speaker recognition system, this approach achieves improvements of up to 22 {\{}{\%}{\}} in EER and 28 {\{}{\%}{\}} in minimum decision cost function (DCF) over our previous baseline. We also achieve substantial improvements over an MLLR-SVM system that performs WCCN in the PCA space but discards the PCA-complement.

abstract = {High frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been observed in animal and human intracranial recordings during both normal and aberrant brain states. It has been proposed that the relationship between subclasses of these oscillations can be used to identify epileptic brain. Studies of HFOs in epilepsy have been hampered by selection bias arising primarily out of the need to reduce the volume of data so that clinicians can manually review it. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for detecting and classifying these signals automatically, and demonstrate the tractability of analyzing a data set of unprecedented size, over 31,000 channel-hours of intracranial electroencephalographic recordings (iEEG) from micro and macroelectrodes in humans. Using an unsupervised approach that does not presuppose a specific number of clusters in the data, we show direct evidence for the existence of distinct classes of transient oscillations within the 100 to 500 Hz frequency range in a population of nine neocortical epilepsy patients and two controls. The number of classes we find, four - three plus one putative artifact class - is consistent with prior studies that identify "ripple" and "fast ripple" oscillations using human-intensive methods, and additionally identifies a less examined class of mixed-frequency events.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that speaker verification systems performbetter when there is sufficient background trainingdata to deal with nuisance effects of transmission channels.It is also known that these systems perform at theirbest when the sound environment of the training data issimilar to that of the context of use (test context). Forsome applications however, training data from the sametype of sound environment is scarce, whereas a considerableamount of data from a different type of environmentis available. In this paper, we propose a new architecturefor text-independent speaker verification systemsthat are satisfactorily trained by virtue of a limitedamount of application-specific data, supplemented with asufficient amount of training data from some other context.This architecture is based on the extraction of parameters(i-vectors) from a low-dimensional space (totalvariability space) proposed by Dehak [1]. Our aim isto extend Dehak's work to speaker recognition on sparsedata, namely microphone speech. The main challenge isto overcome the fact that insufficient application-specificdata is available to accurately estimate the total variabilitycovariance matrix. We propose a method based on JointFactor Analysis (JFA) to estimate microphone eigenchannels(sparse data) with telephone eigenchannels (sufficientdata).For classification, we experimented with the followingtwo approaches: Support Vector Machines (SVM)and Cosine Distance Scoring (CDS) classifier, based oncosine distances. We present recognition results for thepart of female voices in the interview data of the NIST2008 SRE. The best performance is obtained when oursystem is fused with the state-of-the-art JFA. We achieve13{\%} relative improvement on equal error rate and theminimum value of detection cost function decreases from0.0219 to 0.0164.},

@article{Uriguen2015,
abstract = {This paper presents an extensive review on artifact removal algorithms used to remove the main sources of interference encountered in the electroencephalogram (EEG), specifically ocular, muscular and cardiac artifacts. We first introduce background knowledge on the characteristics of EEG activity, of the artifacts and of the EEG measurement model. Then, we present commonly employed algorithms in the literature and describe their key features. Lastly, based principally on the results provided by various researchers, but supported by our own experience, we compare the state-of-the-art methods in terms of reported performance and provide guidelines on how to choose a suitable artifact removal algorithm for a given scenario. With this review we have concluded that, without prior knowledge of the recorded EEG signal or the contaminants, the safest approach is to correct the measured EEG using independent component analysis, precisely an algorithm based on second order statistics such as second order blind identification (SOBI). Other effective alternatives include extended information-maximization (InfoMax) and the adaptive mixture of independent component analyzers (AMICA), based on higher order statistics. All these algorithms have proved particularly effective with simulations and, more importantly, with data collected in controlled recording conditions. Moreover, whenever prior knowledge is available, then a constrained form of the chosen method should be used in order to incorporate such additional information. Finally, since the best performing algorithm is highly dependent on the type of EEG signal, the artifacts and the signal to contaminant ratio, we believe that the optimal method to remove artifacts from the EEG consists in combining more than one algorithm to correct the signal using multiple processing stages, even though this is an option largely unexplored by researchers in the area.},

However, progress toward reliable seizure forecasting has been hampered by lack of open access to long duration recordings with an adequate number of seizures for investigators to rigorously compare algorithms and results. A seizure forecasting competition was conducted on kaggle.com using open access chronic ambulatory intracranial electroencephalography from five canines with naturally occurring epilepsy and two humans undergoing prolonged wide bandwidth intracranial electroencephalographic monitoring. Data were provided to participants as 10-min interictal and preictal clips, with approximately half of the 60 GB data bundle labelled (interictal/preictal) for algorithm training and half unlabelled for evaluation. The contestants developed custom algorithms and uploaded their classifications (interictal/preictal) for the unknown testing data, and a randomly selected 40{\%} of data segments were scored and results broadcasted on a public leader board. The contest ran from August to November 2014, and 654 participants submitted 17 856 classifications of the unlabelled test data. The top performing entry scored 0.84 area under the classification curve. Following the contest, additional held-out unlabelled data clips were provided to the top 10 participants and they submitted classifications for the new unseen data. The resulting area under the classification curves were well above chance forecasting, but did show a mean 6.54 ± 2.45{\%} (min, max: 0.30, 20.2) decline in performance. The kaggle.com model using open access data and algorithms generated reproducible research that advanced seizure forecasting. The overall performance from multiple contestants on unseen data was better than a random predictor, and demonstrates the feasibility of seizure forecasting in canine and human epilepsy.media-1vid110.1093/brain/aww045{\_}video{\_}abstractaww045{\_}video{\_}abstract.},

abstract = {A new Multi-Spiking Neural Network (MuSpiNN) model is presented in which information from one neuron is transmitted to the next in the form of multiple spikes via multiple synapses. A new supervised learning algorithm, dubbed Multi-SpikeProp, is developed for training MuSpiNN. The model and learning algorithm employ the heuristic rules and optimum parameter values presented by the authors in a recent paper that improved the efficiency of the original single-spiking Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model by two orders of magnitude. The classification accuracies of MuSpiNN and Multi-SpikeProp are evaluated using three increasingly more complicated problems: the XOR problem, the Fisher iris classification problem, and the epilepsy and seizure detection (EEG classification) problem. It is observed that MuSpiNN learns the XOR problem in twice the number of epochs compared with the single-spiking SNN model but requires only one-fourth the number of synapses. For the iris and EEG classification problems, a modular architecture is employed to reduce each 3-class classification problem to three 2-class classification problems and improve the classification accuracy. For the complicated EEG classification problem a classification accuracy in the range of 90.7{\%}-94.8{\%} was achieved, which is significantly higher than the 82{\%} classification accuracy obtained using the single-spiking SNN with SpikeProp. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the major reasons why speech models, based on Markov chains, have not been developed until recently was the lack of a method for optimizing the parameters of the Markov model to match observed signal patterns. Such a method was proposed in the late 1960's and was immediately applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range of applications of these models. It is the purpose of this tutorial paper to give an introduction to the theory of Markov models, and to illustrate how they have been applied to problems in speech recognition.},

abstract = {Objective. Most BCIs have to undergo a calibration session in which data is recorded to train decoders with machine learning. Only recently zero-training methods have become a subject of study. This work proposes a probabilistic framework for BCI applications which exploit event-related potentials (ERPs). For the example of a visual P300 speller we show how the framework harvests the structure suitable to solve the decoding task by (a) transfer learning, (b) unsupervised adaptation, (c) language model and (d) dynamic stopping. Approach. A simulation study compares the proposed probabilistic zero framework (using transfer learning and task structure) to a state-of-the-art supervised model on n = 22 subjects. The individual influence of the involved components (a)-(d) are investigated. Main results. Without any need for a calibration session, the probabilistic zero-training framework with inter-subject transfer learning shows excellent performance-competitive to a state-of-the-art supervised method using calibration. Its decoding quality is carried mainly by the effect of transfer learning in combination with continuous unsupervised adaptation. Significance. A high-performing zero-training BCI is within reach for one of the most popular BCI paradigms: ERP spelling. Recording calibration data for a supervised BCI would require valuable time which is lost for spelling. The time spent on calibration would allow a novel user to spell 29 symbols with our unsupervised approach. It could be of use for various clinical and non-clinical ERP-applications of BCI.},

abstract = {The process of manually labeling data is very expensive and sometimes infeasible due to privacy and security issues. This paper investigates the use of two algorithms for clustering unla-beled training i-vectors. This aims at improving speaker recog-nition performance by using state-of-the-art supervised tech-niques in the context of the NIST i-vector Machine Learning Challenge 2014. The first algorithm is the well-known Ward clustering that aims at optimizing an objective function across all clusters. The second one is a cascade clustering, which ben-efits from the latest advances in speaker modeling and session compensation techniques, and relies on both the cosine similar-ity and probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA). Fur-thermore, this paper investigates the multi-clustering fusion that opens the door for further improvements. The experimental re-sults show that the use of the automatically labeled i-vectors to train supervised methods such as LDA, PLDA or linear logistic regression-based fusion, decreases the minimum decision cost function by up to 22{\%}.},

abstract = {Measures of event-related band power such as event-related desynchronization (ERD) are conventionally analyzed within fixed frequency bands, although it is known that EEG frequency varies as a function of a variety of factors. The question of how to determine these frequency bands for ERD analyses is discussed and a new method is proposed. The rationale of this new method is to adjust the frequency bands to the individual alpha frequency (IAF) for each subject and to determine the bandwidth for the alpha and theta bands as a percentage of IAF. As an example, if IAF equals 12 Hz, the widths of the alpha and theta bands are larger as compared to a subject with an IAF of, e.g., only 8 Hz. The results of an oddball paradigm show that the proposed method is superior to methods that are based on fixed frequencies and fixed bandwidths.},

abstract = {Machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms have in the past years developed to become a working horse in brain imaging and the computational neurosciences, as they are instrumental for mining vast amounts of neural data of ever increasing measurement precision and detecting minuscule signals from an overwhelming noise floor. They provide the means to decode and characterize task relevant brain states and to distinguish them from non-informative brain signals. While undoubtedly this machinery has helped to gain novel biological insights, it also holds the danger of potential unintentional abuse. Ideally machine learning techniques should be usable for any non-expert, however, unfortunately they are typically not. Overfitting and other pitfalls may occur and lead to spurious and nonsensical interpretation. The goal of this review is therefore to provide an accessible and clear introduction to the strengths and also the inherent dangers of machine learning usage in the neurosciences. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Clinical electroencephalography (EEG) records vast amounts of human complex data yet is still reviewed primarily by human readers. Deep belief nets (DBNs) are a relatively new type of multi-layer neural network commonly tested on two-dimensional image data but are rarely applied to times-series data such as EEG. We apply DBNs in a semi-supervised paradigm to model EEG waveforms for classification and anomaly detection. DBN performance was comparable to standard classifiers on our EEG dataset, and classification time was found to be 1.7-103.7 times faster than the other high-performing classifiers. We demonstrate how the unsupervised step of DBN learning produces an autoencoder that can naturally be used in anomaly measurement. We compare the use of raw, unprocessed data--a rarity in automated physiological waveform analysis--with hand-chosen features and find that raw data produce comparable classification and better anomaly measurement performance. These results indicate that DBNs and raw data inputs may be more effective for online automated EEG waveform recognition than other common techniques.},

In this paper, we present pilot results of experiments on the prediction of some basic attributes of an EEG from the raw EEG signal data using a 3,762 session subset of the corpus. Standard machine learning approaches are shown to be capable of predicting commonly occurring events from simple features with high accuracy on closed-loop testing, and can deliver error rates below 50{\%} on a 6-way open set classification problem.

Unfortunately, there is no theory available to guide model selection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) employing Lyapunov exponents trained with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm on the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. An approach based on the consideration that the EEG signals are chaotic signals was used in developing a reliable classification method for electroencephalographic changes. This consideration was tested successfully using the non-linear dynamics tools, like the computation of Lyapunov exponents. We explored the ability of designed and trained Elman RNNs, combined with the Lyapunov exponents, to discriminate the EEG signals (EEG signals recorded from healthy volunteers with eyes open, epilepsy patients in the epileptogenic zone during a seizure-free interval, and epilepsy patients during epileptic seizures). The RNNs achieved accuracy rates which were higher than that of the feedforward neural network models. The obtained results demonstrated that the proposed RNNs employing the Lyapunov exponents can be useful in analyzing long-term EEG signals for early detection of the electroencephalographic changes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Non-parametric Bayesian methods have recently gained popularity in several research areas dealing with unsupervised learning. These models are capable of simultaneously learning the cluster models as well as their number based on properties of a dataset. The most commonly applied models are using Dirichlet process priors and Gaussian models, called as Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture models (DPGMMs). Recently, von Mises-Fisher mixture models (VMMs) have also been gaining popularity in modelling high-dimensional unit-normalized features such as text documents and gene expression data. VMMs are potentially more efficient in modeling certain speech representations such as i-vector data when compared to the GMM-based models, as they work with unit-normalized features based on cosine distance. The current work investigates the applicability of Dirichlet process VMMs (DPVMMs) for i-vector-based speaker clustering and verification, showing that they indeed show superior performance in comparison to DPGMMs in the tasks. In addition, we introduce an implementation of the DPVMMs with variational inference that is publicly available for use.},

abstract = {The primary goal of pattern recognition is supervised or unsupervised classification. Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated, the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently, neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well-known methods used in various stages of a pattern recognition system and identify research topics and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field},

GMM-supervector SVM benefits from both GMM and SVM frameworks to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Conventional Kullback-Leibler (KL) kernel in GMM-supervector SVM classifier limits the adaptation of GMM to mean value and leaves covariance unchanged. In this letter, we introduce the GMM-UBM mean interval (GUMI) concept based on the Bhattacharyya distance. This leads to a new kernel for SVM classifier. Comparing with the KL kernel, the new kernel allows us to exploit the information not only from the mean but also from the covariance.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This paper focusses on the person identification problem based on features extracted from the ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG). A bilinear rather than a purely linear model is fitted on the EEG signal, prompted by the existence of non-linear components in the EEG signal--a conjecture already investigated in previous research works. The novelty of the present work lies in the comparison between the linear and the bilinear results, obtained from real field EEG data, aiming towards identification of healthy subjects rather than classification of pathological cases for diagnosis. METHODS: The EEG signal of a, in principle, healthy individual is processed via (non)linear (AR, bilinear) methods and classified by an artificial neural network classifier. RESULTS: Experiments performed on real field data show that utilization of the bilinear model parameters as features improves correct classification scores at the cost of increased complexity and computations. Results are seen to be statistically significant at the 99.5{\%} level of significance, via the chi 2 test for contingency. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in the present study further corroborate existing research, which shows evidence that the EEG carries individual-specific information, and that it can be successfully exploited for purposes of person identification and authentication.},

Comparative analysis with other state of the art methods on both synthetic benchmark examples and a well established BCI motor imagery dataset support the analysis.},

abstract = {Multi-subject electroencephalography (EEG) classification involves algorithm development for automatically categorizing brain waves measured from multiple subjects who undergo the same mental task. Common spatial patterns (CSP) or its probabilistic counterpart, PCSP, is a popular discriminative feature extraction method for EEG classification. Models in CSP or PCSP are trained on a subject-by-subject basis so that inter-subject information is neglected. In the case of multi-subject EEG classification, however, it is desirable to capture inter-subject relatedness in learning a model. In this paper we present a nonparametric Bayesian model for a multi-subject extension of PCSP where subject relatedness is captured by assuming that spatial patterns across subjects share a latent subspace. Spatial patterns and the shared latent subspace are jointly learned by variational inference. We use an infinite latent feature model to automatically infer the dimension of the shared latent subspace, placing Indian Buffet process (IBP) priors on our model. Numerical experiments on BCI competition III IVa and IV 2a dataset demonstrate the high performance of our method, compared to PCSP and existing Bayesian multi-task CSP models. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.Electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely used in a variety of contexts, including medical monitoring of subjects as well as performance monitoring in healthy individuals. Recent technological advances have now enabled researchers to quickly record and collect EEG on a wide scale. Although EEG is fairly easy to record, it is highly susceptible to noise sources called artifacts which can occur at amplitudes several times greater than the EEG signal of interest. Because of this, users must manually annotate the EEG signal to identify artifact regions in the data prior to any downstream processing. This can be time-consuming and impractical for large data collections. In this paper we present a method which uses Active Learning (AL) to improve the reliability of existing EEG artifact classifiers with minimal amounts of user interaction. Our results show that classification accuracy equivalent to classifiers trained on full data annotation can be obtained while labeling less than 25{\%} of the data. This suggests significant time savings can be obtained when manually annotating artifacts in large EEG data collections.},

Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems can make use of such knowledge to deliver relevant feedback to the user or to an observer, or within a human-machine system to increase safety and enhance overall performance. Building robust and useful BCI models from accumulated biological knowledge and available data is a major challenge, as are technical problems associated with incorporating multimodal physiological, behavioral, and contextual data that may in the future be increasingly ubiquitous. While performance of current BCI modeling methods is slowly increasing, current performance levels do not yet support widespread uses.

We describe a variational Bayes algo-rithm for calculating i-vectors exactly which converges in a few iterations and whose computational and memory requirements scale linearly rather than quadratically. For typical i-vector dimensionalities, the computational requirements are slightly greater than those of the traditional algorithm. The run time memory requirement is scarcely greater than that needed to store the eigenvoice basis. Because it is an exact method, the variational Bayes algorithm enables the construction of i-vector extractors of much higher dimensionality than has previously been envisaged. We show that modest gains in speaker verifi-cation accuracy (as measured by the 2010 NIST detection cost function) can be achieved using high dimensional i-vectors.},

Three minutes eyes closed resting EEG was compared between 62 individuals with ADHD (36 children, 26 adults) and 55 typically developing individuals (30 children, 25 adults). EEG activity and maturation did not differ between individuals with ADHD and typically developing individuals. However, despite comparable developmental course between clinical groups, persistent elevated theta/beta ratio and reduced relative beta power were observed in the ADHD inattentive subtype compared to the ADHD combined subtype and controls across the lifespan. Therefore, a maturational deviation rather than a maturational delay may underlie a subgroup of ADHD. EEG based classification failed for ADHD but proved successful for age. These findings emphasize heterogeneity in ADHD throughout the lifespan and question clinical utility of conventional EEG approaches for diagnostic purposes in ADHD.},

This paper explores the origin of these limitations, and introduces an alternative and more stable agreement coefficient referred to as the AC1 coefficient. Also proposed are new variance estimators for the multiple-rater generalized $\pi$ and AC1 statistics, whose validity does not depend upon the hypothesis of independence between raters. This is an improvement over existing alternative variances, which depend on the independence assumption. A Monte-Carlo simulation study demonstrates the validity of these variance estimators for confidence interval construction, and confirms the value of AC1 as an improved alternative to existing inter-rater reliability statistics.},

During operation, the system recurrently reselects only one out of six predefined logarithmic bandpower features (10-13 and 16-24 Hz from Laplacian derivations over C3, Cz, and C4), specifically, the feature that exhibits maximum discriminability. The system then retrains a linear discriminant analysis classifier on all available data and updates the online paradigm with the new model. Every retraining step is preceded by an online outlier rejection. Operating the system requires no engineering knowledge other than connecting the user and starting the system.

abstract = {Currently, sleep disorders are considered as one of the major human life issues. There are several stable physiological stages that the human brain goes through during sleep. Nowadays, many biomedical signals such as EEG, ECG, EMG, and EOG offer useful details for clinical setups that are used in identifying sleep disorders. In this work, we propose an efficient technique that could be implemented in hardware to differentiate sleep stages which will assist physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of related sleep disorders. This study depends on different EEG datasets from PhysioNet using the Sleep-EDF [Expanded] Database that were acquired and described by scientists for the analysis and diagnosis of sleep stages. Generally, the EEG signal is decomposed into five bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma to define the change in brain state. In this work, Butterworth band-pass filters are designed to filter and decompose EEG into the above frequency sub-bands. In addition, various discriminating features including energy, standard deviation and entropy are computed and extracted from each $\delta$, □, $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ sub-band. Furthermore, the extracted features are then fed to a supervised learning classifier; support vector machine (SVM) to be able to recognize the sleep stages state and identify if the acquired signal is corresponding to wake or stage 1 of sleep, according to the purpose of this research. The key novelty of this work is to identify the sleep stages from a publicly available EEG signal dataset by using a feasible set of features, easily implementable filters in any microcontroller device, and an efficient classification method. Therefore, physicians can track these sleep stages to identify certain patterns such as detecting fatigue, drowsiness, and/or various sleep disorders such as sleep apnea. The experimental results on a variety of subjects verify 92.5{\%} of classification accuracy of the proposed work. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {The perception of pain is characterized by its tremendous intra- and interindividual variability. Different individuals perceive the very same painful event largely differently. Here, we aimed to predict the individual pain sensitivity from brain activity. We repeatedly applied identical painful stimuli to healthy human subjects and recorded brain activity by using electroencephalography (EEG). We applied a multivariate pattern analysis to the time-frequency transformed single-trial EEG responses. Our results show that a classifier trained on a group of healthy individuals can predict another individual's pain sensitivity with an accuracy of 83{\%}. Classification accuracy depended on pain-evoked responses at about 8 Hz and pain-induced gamma oscillations at about 80 Hz. These results reveal that the temporal-spectral pattern of pain-related neuronal responses provides valuable information about the perception of pain. Beyond, our approach may help to establish an objective neuronal marker of pain sensitivity which can potentially be recorded from a single EEG electrode.},

abstract = {Despite several approaches to realize subject-to-subject transfer of pre-trained classifiers, the full performance of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for a novel user can only be reached by presenting the BCI system with data from the novel user. In typical state-of-the-art BCI systems with a supervised classifier, the labeled data is collected during a calibration recording, in which the user is asked to perform a specific task. Based on the known labels of this recording, the BCI's classifier can learn to decode the individual's brain signals. Unfortunately, this calibration recording consumes valuable time. Furthermore, it is unproductive with respect to the final BCI application, e.g. text entry. Therefore, the calibration period must be reduced to a minimum, which is especially important for patients with a limited concentration ability. The main contribution of this manuscript is an online study on unsupervised learning in an auditory event-related potential (ERP) paradigm. Our results demonstrate that the calibration recording can be bypassed by utilizing an unsupervised trained classifier, that is initialized randomly and updated during usage. Initially, the unsupervised classifier tends to make decoding mistakes, as the classifier might not have seen enough data to build a reliable model. Using a constant re-analysis of the previously spelled symbols, these initially misspelled symbols can be rectified posthoc when the classifier has learned to decode the signals. We compare the spelling performance of our unsupervised approach and of the unsupervised posthoc approach to the standard supervised calibration-based dogma for n = 10 healthy users. To assess the learning behavior of our approach, it is unsupervised trained from scratch three times per user. Even with the relatively low SNR of an auditory ERP paradigm, the results show that after a limited number of trials (30 trials), the unsupervised approach performs comparably to a classic supervised model.},

abstract = {We propose a new approach to the problem of estimating the hyperparameters which define the interspeaker variability model in joint factor analysis. We tested the proposed estimation technique on the NIST 2006 speaker recognition evaluation data and obtained 10{\%}-15{\%} reductions in error rates on the core condition and the extended data condition (as measured both by equal error rates and the NIST detection cost function). We show that when a large joint factor analysis model is trained in this way and tested on the core condition, the extended data condition and the cross-channel condition, it is capable of performing at least as well as fusions of multiple systems of other types. (The comparisons are based on the best results on these tasks that have been reported in the literature.) In the case of the cross-channel condition, a factor analysis model with 300 speaker factors and 200 channel factors can achieve equal error rates of less than 3.0{\%}. This is a substantial improvement over the best results that have previously been reported on this task.},

abstract = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) data are typically contaminated with artifacts (e.g., by eye movements). The effect of artifacts can be attenuated by deleting data with amplitudes over a certain value, for example. Independent component analysis (ICA) separates EEG data into neural activity and artifact; once identified, artifactual components can be deleted from the data. Often, artifact rejection algorithms require supervision (e.g., training using canonical artifacts). Many artifact rejection methods are time consuming when applied to high-density EEG data. We describe FASTER (Fully Automated Statistical Thresholding for EEG artifact Rejection). Parameters were estimated for various aspects of data (e.g., channel variance) in both the EEG time series and in the independent components of the EEG: outliers were detected and removed. FASTER was tested on both simulated EEG (n=47) and real EEG (n=47) data on 128-, 64-, and 32-scalp electrode arrays. FASTER was compared to supervised artifact detection by experts and to a variant of the Statistical Control for Dense Arrays of Sensors (SCADS) method. FASTER had {\textgreater}90{\%} sensitivity and specificity for detection of contaminated channels, eye movement and EMG artifacts, linear trends and white noise. FASTER generally had {\textgreater}60{\%} sensitivity and specificity for detection of contaminated epochs, vs. 0.15{\%} for SCADS. FASTER also aggregates the ERP across subject datasets, and detects outlier datasets. The variance in the ERP baseline, a measure of noise, was significantly lower for FASTER than either the supervised or SCADS methods. ERP amplitude did not differ significantly between FASTER and the supervised approach. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

In particular, we speculate about the stability of EEG features by analyzing the recognition performance that can be achieved when comparing EEG signals acquired during different sessions. We carry out an extensive set of experimental tests, performed on several EEG-based biometric systems over a large database, comprising three recordings taken from 50 healthy subjects in resting state conditions, acquired in a time span of approximately one month and a half.

Specifically, we propose to reduce the noise level through ensemble averaging and low-pass filter, extract frequency features using wavelet packet decomposition, and perform classification based on an artificial neural network. We explicitly discuss four different scenarios to emulate different application cases in authentication. Experimental results show that: the classification rates of distinguishing one subject or a small group of individuals (e.g., authorized personnel) from others (e.g., unauthorized personnel) can reach around 90{\%}. However, it is also shown that recognizing each individual subject from a large pool has the worst performance with a classification rate of less than 11{\%}. The side-by-side method shows an improvement on identifying all the subjects with classification rates of around 40{\%}. Our study lays a solid foundation for future investigation of innovative, brainwave-based biometric approaches.},

abstract = {Biweekly EEGs (O1C3 leads) were recorded under relaxed conditions with the eyes open, from 10 young female subjects throughout the menstrual cycle, and from 2 male subjects. The records were subjected to broad-band frequency analysis of successive 30 sec epochs, during sessions lasting 10 min. Statistical analysis showed that for all amplitude measures, absolute and relative, the variance between different individuals was significantly greater than between repeated measurements in the same individual. The individual differences were expressed in the form of characteristic amplitude profiles for the classical EEG frequency bands. The variance of each subject's profile could be reduced by using a 'percentage' amplitude score instead of the absolute values. The individuality of EEG patterns expressed itself also in the ratios between the activities at specific frequencies: a given ratio could be virtually invariant in one or two persons while being highly inconsistent in other subjects. No particular pattern could be discerned in these differences. The present results confirm the existence of a sufficient degree of EEG reproducibility, at least un normal young women, to justify speaking of characteristic individual 'baseline' patterns during quiet wakefulness. It will be worthwhile now to investigate if deviations occur from such baselines which might be of importance in psychiatric diagnosis. ?? 1979.},

We first describe the history of the studies on the effects of using exogenous stress hormones such as glucocorticoids as anti-inflammatory medications on human cognition and mental health. Here, we summarize the cases that led to the diagnosis of glucocorticoid-induced 'steroid psychosis' in human populations and which demonstrated that these stress hormones could thus cross the blood-brain barrier and access the brain where they could influence cognition and mental health. We then summarize studies that assessed the effects of the exogenous administration of glucocorticoids on cognitive performance supported by the hippocampus, the frontal lobes and amygdala. In the second section of the paper, we summarize the effects of the endogenous release of glucocorticoids induced by exposure to a stressful situation on human cognition and we further dissociate the effects of emotion from those of stress on human learning and memory. Finally, in the last section of the paper, we discuss the potential impact that the environmental context to which we expose participants when assessing their memory could have on their reactivity to stress and subsequent cognitive performance. In order to make our point, we discuss the field of memory and aging and we suggest that some of the 'age-related memory impairments' observed in the literature could be partly due to increased stress reactivity in older adults to the environmental context of testing. We also discuss the inverse negative correlations reported between hippocampal volume and memory for young and older adults and suggest that these inverse correlations could be partly due to the effects of contextual stress in young and older adults, as a function of age-related differences in hippocampal volume. ?? 2007.},

abstract = {A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system based on motor imagery (MI) identifies patterns of electrical brain activity to predict the user intention while certain movement imagination tasks are performed. Currently, one of the most important challenges is the adaptive design of a BCI system. For solving it, this work explores dimensionality reduction techniques: once features have been extracted from Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, the high-dimensional EEG data has to be mapped onto a new reduced feature space to make easier the classification stage. Besides the standard sequential feature selection methods, this paper analyzes two unsupervised transformation-based approaches - Principal Component Analysis and Locality Preserving Projections - and the Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis (LFDA), which works in a supervised manner. The dimensionality in the projected space is chosen following a wrapper-based approach by an efficient leave-one-out estimation. Experiments have been conducted on five novice subjects during their first sessions with MI-based BCI systems in order to show that the appropriate use of dimensionality reduction methods allows increasing the performance. In particular, obtained results show that LFDA gives a significant enhancement in classification terms without increasing the computational complexity and, then, it is a promising technique for designing MI-based BCI system. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {With the increasing popularity of using electroencephalography (EEG) to reveal the treatment effect in drug development clinical trials, the vast volume and complex nature of EEG data compose an intriguing, but challenging, topic. In this paper the statistical analysis methods recommended by the EEG community, along with methods frequently used in the published literature, are first reviewed. A straightforward adjustment of the existing methods to handle multichannel EEG data is then introduced. In addition, based on the spatial smoothness property of EEG data, a new category of statistical methods is proposed. The new methods use a linear combination of low-degree spherical harmonic (SPHARM) basis functions to represent a spatially smoothed version of the EEG data on the scalp, which is close to a sphere in shape. In total, seven statistical methods, including both the existing and the newly proposed methods, are applied to two clinical datasets to compare their power to detect a drug effect. Contrary to the EEG community's recommendation, our results suggest that (1) the nonparametric method does not outperform its parametric counterpart; and (2) including baseline data in the analysis does not always improve the statistical power. In addition, our results recommend that (3) simple paired statistical tests should be avoided due to their poor power; and (4) the proposed spatially smoothed methods perform better than their unsmoothed versions. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The development of a quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG)-based procedure for use in the assessment of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was examined through a series of studies investigating test reliability and validation issues. This process, involving a spectral analysis of the electrophysiological power output from a single, midline, central location (the vertex), was conducted in 469 participants, 6 to 20 years of age, classified as ADHD, inattentive type; ADHD, combined type; or control. The results indicated that the QEEG scanning procedure was reliable (r = .96), was consistent with the Attention Deficit Disorders Evaluation Scale (S. B. McCarney, 1995) and the Test of Variables of Attention (L. M. Greenberg, 1994; chi-square, p {\textless} .01), and differentiated participants with ADHD from a nonclinical control group (p {\textless} .001). The sensitivity of the QEEG-derived attentional index was 90{\%}; the specificity was 94{\%}.},

In practical applications of pattern recognition, there are often diverse features extracted from raw data which needs recognizing. Because of the importance of making the right decision, the present work is carried out for searching better classification procedures for the EEG signals. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction by eigenvector methods and classification using the classifiers trained on the extracted features. The aim of the study is classification of the EEG signals by the combination of eigenvector methods and the RNN. The present research demonstrated that the power levels of the power spectral density (PSD) estimates obtained by the eigenvector methods are the features which well represent the EEG signals and the RNN trained on these features achieved high classification accuracies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A prototyp- ical example of this is the one-shot learning set- ting, in which we must correctly make predic- tions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we explore a method for learning siamese neural networks which employ a unique structure to naturally rank similarity be- tween inputs. Once a network has been tuned, we can then capitalize on powerful discrimina- tive features to generalize the predictive power of the network not just to new data, but to entirely newclasses from unknown distributions. Using a convolutional architecture, we are able to achieve strong results which exceed those of other deep learning models with near state-of-the-art perfor- mance on one-shot classification tasks.},

abstract = {Given several related learning tasks, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian model that captures task relatedness by assuming that the task parameters (i.e., predictors) share a latent subspace. More specifically, the intrinsic dimensionality of the task subspace is not assumed to be known a priori. We use an infinite latent feature model to automatically infer this number (depending on and limited by only the number of tasks). Furthermore, our approach is applicable when the underlying task parameter subspace is inherently sparse, drawing parallels with ℓ 1 regularization and LASSO-style models. We also propose an augmented model which can make use of (labeled, and additionally unlabeled if available) inputs to assist learning this subspace, leading to further improvements in the performance. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of both the proposed approaches, especially when the number of examples per task is small. Finally, we discuss an extension of the proposed framework where a nonparametric mixture of linear subspaces can be used to learn a nonlinear manifold over the task parameters, and also deal with the issue of negative transfer from unrelated tasks.

The term ‘BCI-illiteracy' describes the impossibility of using a BCI paradigm. At present, a universal solution does not exist and seeking innovative protocols to drive a BCI is mandatory. This work presents a meta-analytic review on recent advances in emotions recognition with the perspective of using emotions as voluntary, stimulus-independent, commands for BCIs. 60 papers, based on electroencephalography measurements, were selected to evaluate what emotions have been most recognised and what brain regions were activated by them. It was found that happiness, sadness, anger and calm were the most recognised emotions. Relevant discriminant locations for emotions recognition and for the particular case of discrete emotions recognition were identified in the temporal, frontal and parietal areas. The meta-analysis was mainly performed on stimulus-elicited emotions, due to the limited amount of literature about self-induced emotions. The obtained results represent a good starting point for the development of BCI driven by emotions and allow to: (1) ascertain that emotions are measurable and recognisable one from another (2) select a subset of most recognisable emotions and the corresponding active brain regions.},

abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) and blind source separation (BSS) methods are increasingly used to separate individual brain and non-brain source signals mixed by volume conduction in electroencephalographic (EEG) and other electrophysiological recordings. We compared results of decomposing thirteen 71-channel human scalp EEG datasets by 22 ICA and BSS algorithms, assessing the pairwise mutual information (PMI) in scalp channel pairs, the remaining PMI in component pairs, the overall mutual information reduction (MIR) effected by each decomposition, and decomposition 'dipolarity' defined as the number of component scalp maps matching the projection of a single equivalent dipole with less than a given residual variance. The least well-performing algorithm was principal component analysis (PCA); best performing were AMICA and other likelihood/mutual information based ICA methods. Though these and other commonly-used decomposition methods returned many similar components, across 18 ICA/BSS algorithms mean dipolarity varied linearly with both MIR and with PMI remaining between the resulting component time courses, a result compatible with an interpretation of many maximally independent EEG components as being volume-conducted projections of partially-synchronous local cortical field activity within single compact cortical domains. To encourage further method comparisons, the data and software used to prepare the results have been made available (http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/BSSComparison).},

This is true for GMM supervector systems, joint factor analysis systems, and most recently i-vector systems. In all of these systems, the posterior probabilities and sufficient statistics calculations represent a computational bottleneck in both enrollment and testing. We propose a multi-layered hash system, employing a tree-structured GMM-UBM which uses Runnalls' Gaussian mixture reduction technique, in order to reduce the number of these calculations. With this tree-structured hash, we can trade-off reduction in computation with a corresponding degradation of equal error rate (EER). As an example, we reduce this computation by a factor of 15 ?? while incurring less than 10{\%} relative degradation of EER (or 0.3{\%} absolute EER) when evaluated with NIST 2010 speaker recognition evaluation (SRE) telephone data.},

The formulation of the Fisher criterion is based on the L2-norm, which makes LDA prone to being affected by the presence of outliers. In this paper, we propose a new method, termed LDA-L1, by maximizing the ratio of the between-class dispersion to the within-class dispersion using the L1-norm rather than the L2-norm. LDA-L1 is robust to outliers, and is solved by an iterative algorithm proposed. The algorithm is easy to be implemented and is theoretically shown to arrive at a locally maximal point. LDA-L1 does not suffer from the problems of small sample size and rank limit as existed in the conventional LDA. Experiment results of image recognition confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Transient high-frequency (100-500 Hz) oscillations of the local field potential have been studied extensively in human mesial temporal lobe. Previous studies report that both ripple (100-250 Hz) and fast ripple (250-500 Hz) oscillations are increased in the seizure-onset zone of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Comparatively little is known, however, about their spatial distribution with respect to seizure-onset zone in neocortical epilepsy, or their prevalence in normal brain. We present a quantitative analysis of high-frequency oscillations and their rates of occurrence in a group of nine patients with neocortical epilepsy and two control patients with no history of seizures. Oscillations were automatically detected and classified using an unsupervised approach in a data set of unprecedented volume in epilepsy research, over 12 terabytes of continuous long-term micro- and macro-electrode intracranial recordings, without human preprocessing, enabling selection-bias-free estimates of oscillation rates. There are three main results: (i) a cluster of ripple frequency oscillations with median spectral centroid = 137 Hz is increased in the seizure-onset zone more frequently than a cluster of fast ripple frequency oscillations (median spectral centroid = 305 Hz); (ii) we found no difference in the rates of high frequency oscillations in control neocortex and the non-seizure-onset zone neocortex of patients with epilepsy, despite the possibility of different underlying mechanisms of generation; and (iii) while previous studies have demonstrated that oscillations recorded by parenchyma-penetrating micro-electrodes have higher peak 100-500 Hz frequencies than penetrating macro-electrodes, this was not found for the epipial electrodes used here to record from the neocortical surface. We conclude that the relative rate of ripple frequency oscillations is a potential biomarker for epileptic neocortex, but that larger prospective studies correlating high-frequency oscillations rates with seizure-onset zone, resected tissue and surgical outcome are required to determine the true predictive value.},

Then these features were used as an input to a support vector machine (SVM) with two discrete outputs: epileptic seizure or not. The performance of classification process due to different methods is presented and compared to show the excellent of classification process. These findings are presented as an example of a method for training, and testing a seizure prediction method on data from individual petit mal epileptic patients.

abstract = {This paper discusses the potential of the EEG signal for implementation of a practical biometric system using 4 or less channels of 2 different types of EEG recordings. Studies have shown that the EEG signal has biometric potential because the signal varies from person to person and is impossible to replicate and steal. Data were collected from 10 male subjects while resting with eyes open and eyes closed in 5 separate sessions conducted over a course of 2 weeks. Features were extracted using the autoregressive (AR) model and analyzed to obtain the feature set. Results show that data from eyes open and eyes closed using 4 channels gave good classification rates of 96{\%} and 97{\%} respectively and that data recorded from 2 channels gave classification rates from 90{\%} to 95{\%}. Classification rates from 1 channel ranged from 70{\%} to 87{\%}. The average time taken for recognition was 0.38 seconds at the point of recognition. Based on these results, there is potential for implementation of an EEG-based biometric system.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the use of continuous prosodic features for speaker recognition, and we show how they can be modeled using joint factor analysis. Similar features have been successfully used in language identification. These prosodic features are pitch and energy contours spanning a syllable-like unit. They are extracted using a basis consisting of Legendre polynomials. Since the feature vectors are continuous (rather than discrete), they can be modeled using a standard Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Furthermore, speaker and session variability effects can be modeled in the same way as in conventional joint factor analysis. We find that the best results are obtained when we use the information about the pitch, energy, and the duration of the unit all together. Testing on the core condition of NIST 2006 speaker recognition evaluation data gives an equal error rate of 16.6{\%} and 14.6{\%}, with prosodic features alone, for all trials and English-only trials, respectively. When the prosodic system is fused with a state-of-the-art cepstral joint factor analysis system, we obtain a relative improvement of 8{\%} (all trials) and 12{\%} (English only) compared to the cepstral system alone.},

The shape of the wave may contain useful information about the state of the brain. However, the human observer cannot directly monitor these subtle details. Besides, since bio-signals are highly subjective, the symptoms may appear at random in the time scale. Therefore, the EEG signal parameters, extracted and analyzed using computers, are highly useful in diagnostics. The aim of this work is to compare the different entropy estimators when applied to EEG data from normal and epileptic subjects. The results obtained indicate that entropy estimators can distinguish normal and epileptic EEG data with more than 95{\%} confidence (using t-test). The classification ability of the entropy measures is tested using ANFIS classifier. The results are promising and a classification accuracy of about 90{\%} is achieved. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Typically, a speaker model is constructed by MAP adaptation of the means of the UBM. A GMM supervector is constructed by stacking the means of the adapted mixture components. A recent discovery is that latent factor analysis of this GMM supervector is an effective method for variability compensation. We consider this GMM supervector in the context of support vector machines. We construct a support vector machine kernel using the GMM supervector. We show similarities based on this kernel between the method of SVM nuisance attribute projection (NAP) and the recent results in latent factor analysis.

abstract = {The electroencephalogram (EEG) bears the possibility to investigate oscillatory processes in the human brain. In the animal brain it has been shown that the phase of cortical oscillations is related to the exact timing of neural activity. The potential role of oscillatory phase and phase synchronization for the explanation of cortical information processing has been largely underestimated in the human EEG until now. Here it is argued that EEG phase (synchronization) reflects the exact timing of communication between distant but functionally related neural populations, the exchange of information between global and local neuronal networks, and the sequential temporal activity of neural processes in response to incoming sensory stimuli. Three different kinds of phase synchronization are discussed: (i) phase coupling between brain sites, (ii) phase synchronization across frequencies, and (iii) phase-locking to external events. In this review recent work is presented demonstrating that EEG phase synchronization provides valuable information about the neural correlates of various cognitive processes, and that it leads to a better understanding of how memory and attention processes are interrelated. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Objectives: This study investigated age-related changes and sex differences in the EEGs of two groups of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) combined type and ADHD predominantly inattentive type, in comparison with a control group of normal children. Methods: Forty boys and forty girls were included in each group. The EEG was recorded during an eyes-closed resting condition and Fourier transformed to provide estimates for total power, absolute and relative power in the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands, and for theta/alpha and theta/beta ratios. Results: Total power, relative alpha, and the theta/alpha and theta/beta ratios were differentiated between all 3 groups. Sex differences between the ADHD subjects and the control group were greater in males than females and matured faster in males. With increasing age, the EEG of the ADHD inattentive group was found to change at a similar rate to the changes found in the normal group, with the differences in power levels remaining constant. In the ADHD combined group, the power was found to change at a greater rate than in the ADHD inattentive group, with power levels of the two ADHD groups becoming similar with age. Conclusions: These results are supportive of a two-component model of ADHD, with the hyperactive/impulsive component maturing with age and the inattentive component remaining more stable. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Based on findings primarily in cats, the grouping of spindle activity and fast brain oscillations by slow oscillations during slow-wave sleep (SWS) has been proposed to represent an essential feature in the processing of memories during sleep. We examined whether a comparable grouping of spindle and fast activity coinciding with slow oscillations can be found in human SWS. For negative and positive half-waves of slow oscillations (dominant frequency, 0.7-0.8 Hz) identified during SWS in humans (n = 13), wave-triggered averages of root mean square (rms) activity in the theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), spindle (12-15 Hz), and beta (15-25 Hz) range were formed. Slow positive half-waves were linked to a pronounced and microV (23.4{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001, with reference to baseline) at the midline central electrode (Cz). In contrast, spindle activity was suppressed during slow negative half-waves, on average by -0.65 +/- 0.06 microV at Cz (-22{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001). An increase in spindle activity 400-500 msec after negative half-waves was more than twofold the increase during slow positive half-waves (p {\textless} 0.001). A similar although less pronounced dynamic was observed for beta activity, but not for alpha and theta frequencies. Discrete spindles identified during stages 2 and 3 of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep coincided with a discrete slow positive half-wave-like potential preceded by a pronounced negative half-wave (p {\textless} 0.01). These results provide the first evidence in humans of grouping of spindle and beta activity during slow oscillations. They support the concept that phases of cortical depolarization during slow oscillations, reflected by surface-positive (depth-negative) field potentials, drive the thalamocortical spindle activity. The drive is particularly strong during cortical depolarization, expressed as surface-positive field potentials.},

abstract = {The paper presents a novel automatic speaker age and gender identification approach which combines seven different methods at both acoustic and prosodic levels to improve the baseline performance. The three baseline subsystems are (1) Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based on mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features, (2) Support vector machine (SVM) based on GMM mean supervectors and (3) SVM based on 450-dimensional utterance level features including acoustic, prosodic and voice quality information. In addition, we propose four subsystems: (1) SVM based on UBM weight posterior probability supervectors using the Bhattacharyya probability product kernel, (2) Sparse representation based on UBM weight posterior probability supervectors, (3) SVM based on GMM maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) matrix supervectors and (4) SVM based on the polynomial expansion coefficients of the syllable level prosodic feature contours in voiced speech segments. Contours of pitch, time domain energy, frequency domain harmonic structure energy and formant for each syllable (segmented using energy information in the voiced speech segment) are considered for analysis in subsystem (4). The proposed four subsystems have been demonstrated to be effective and able to achieve competitive results in classifying different age and gender groups. To further improve the overall classification performance, weighted summation based fusion of these seven subsystems at the score level is demonstrated. Experiment results are reported on the development and test set of the 2010 Interspeech Paralinguistic Challenge aGender database. Compared to the SVM baseline system (3), which is the baseline system suggested by the challenge committee, the proposed fusion system achieves 5.6{\%} absolute improvement in unweighted accuracy for the age task and 4.2{\%} for the gender task on the development set. On the final test set, we obtain 3.1{\%} and 3.8{\%} absolute improvement, respectively.},

Most EEG research focuses either on peaks 'evoked' in average event-related potentials (ERPs) or on changes 'induced' in the EEG power spectrum by experimental events. Although these measures are nearly complementary, they do not fully model the event-related dynamics in the data, and cannot isolate the signals of the contributing cortical areas. We propose that many ERPs and other EEG features are better viewed as time/frequency perturbations of underlying field potential processes. The new approach combines independent component analysis (ICA), time/frequency analysis, and trial-by-trial visualization that measures EEG source dynamics without requiring an explicit head model.},

abstract = {Sleep spindles are thought to induce synaptic changes and thereby contribute to memory consolidation during sleep. Patients with schizophrenia show dramatic reductions of both spindles and sleep-dependent memory consolidation, which may be causally related. To examine the relations of sleep spindle activity to sleep-dependent consolidation of motor procedural memory, 21 chronic, medicated schizophrenia outpatients and 17 healthy volunteers underwent polysomnography on two consecutive nights. On the second night, participants were trained on the finger-tapping motor sequence task (MST) at bedtime and tested the following morning. The number, density, frequency, duration, amplitude, spectral content, and coherence of stage 2 sleep spindles were compared between groups and examined in relation to overnight changes in MST performance. Patients failed to show overnight improvement on the MST and differed significantly from control participants who did improve. Patients also exhibited marked reductions in the density (reduced 38{\%} relative to control participants), number (reduced 36{\%}), and coherence (reduced 19{\%}) of sleep spindles but showed no abnormalities in the morphology of individual spindles or of sleep architecture. In patients, reduced spindle number and density predicted less overnight improvement on the MST. In addition, reduced amplitude and sigma power of individual spindles correlated with greater severity of positive symptoms. The observed sleep spindle abnormalities implicate thalamocortical network dysfunction in schizophrenia. In addition, the findings suggest that abnormal spindle generation impairs sleep-dependent memory consolidation in schizophrenia, contributes to positive symptoms, and is a promising novel target for the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Objective: This review attempts to differentiate neuroelectric measures (electroencephalogram (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related oscillations (EROs)) related to acute and chronic effects of alcohol on the brain from those that reflect underlying deficits related to the predisposition to develop alcoholism and related disorders. The utility of these neuroelectric measures as endophenotypes for psychiatric genetics is evaluated. Methods: This article reviews the main findings of EEG and ERP abnormalities in alcoholics, offspring of alcoholics at high risk to develop alcoholism and the electrophysiological effects of alcohol on high risk compared to low-risk offspring. It highlights findings using EROs, a fast developing tool in examining brain function and cognition. It also reviews evidence of genetic findings related to these electrophysiological measures and their relationship to clinical diagnosis. Results: Many of these abnormal neuroelectric measures are under genetic control, may precede the development of alcoholism, and may be markers of a predisposition toward the development of a spectrum of disinhibitory conditions including alcoholism. Genetic loci underlying some neuroelectic measures that involve neurotransmitter systems of the brain have been identified. Conclusions: Quantitative neuroelectric measures (EEG, ERPs, EROs) provide valuable endophenotypes in the study of genetic risk to develop alcoholism and related disorders. Significance: Genetic studies of neuroelectric endophenotypes offer a powerful strategy for identifying susceptibility genes for developing psychiatric disorders, and provide novel insights into etiological factors. ?? 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

abstract = {Time series are a ubiquitous form of data occurring in virtually every scientific discipline. A common task with time series data is comparing one sequence with another. In some domains a very simple distance measure, such as Euclidean distance will suffice. However, it is often the case that two sequences have the approximately the same overall component shapes, but these shapes do not line up in X-axis. Figure 1 shows this with a simple example. In order to find the similarity between such sequences, or as a preprocessing step before averaging them, we must “warp” the time axis of one (or both) sequences to achieve a better alignment. Dynamic time warping (DTW), is a technique for efficiently achieving this warping. In addition to data mining (Keogh {\&} Pazzani 2000, Yi et. al. 1998, Berndt {\&} Clifford 1994), DTW has been used in gesture recognition (Gavrila {\&} Davis 1995), robotics (Schmill et. al 1999), speech processing (Rabiner {\&} Juang 1993), manufacturing (Gollmer {\&} Posten 1995) and medicine (Caiani et. al 1998).

abstract = {I-vector based recognition is a well-established technique in state-of-the-art speaker and language recognition but its use in dialect and accent classification has received less attention. We represent an experimental study of i-vector based dialect classification, with a special focus on foreign accent detection from spoken Finnish. Using the CallFriend corpus, we first study how recognition accuracy is affected by the choices of various i-vector system parameters, such as the number of Gaussians, i-vector dimensionality and reduction method. We then apply the same methods on the Finnish national foreign language certificate (FSD) corpus and compare the results to traditional Gaussian mixture model - universal background model (GMM-UBM) recognizer. The results, in terms of equal error rate, indicate that i-vectors outperform GMM-UBM as one expects. We also notice that in foreign accent detection, 7 out of 9 accents were more accurately detected by Gaussian scoring than by cosine scoring. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 ISCA.},

@article{Lance2012,
abstract = {As the proliferation of technology dramatically infiltrates all aspects of modern life, in many ways the world is becoming so dynamic and complex that technological capabilities are overwhelming human capabilities to optimally interact with and leverage those technologies. Fortunately, these technological advancements have also driven an explosion of neuroscience research over the past several decades, presenting engineers with a remarkable opportunity to design and develop flexible and adaptive brain-based neurotechnologies that integrate with and capitalize on human capabilities and limitations to improve human-system interactions. Major forerunners of this conception are brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which to this point have been largely focused on improving the quality of life for particular clinical populations and include, for example, applications for advanced communications with paralyzed or “locked in” patients as well as the direct control of prostheses and wheelchairs. Near-term applications are envisioned that are primarily task oriented and are targeted to avoid the most difficult obstacles to development. In the farther term, a holistic approach to BCIs will enable a broad range of task-oriented and opportunistic applications by leveraging pervasive technologies and advanced analytical approaches to sense and merge critical brain, behavioral, task, and environmental information. Communications and other applications that are envisioned to be broadly impacted by BCIs are highlighted; however, these represent just a small sample of the potential of these technologies.},

abstract = {This paper considers a general linear vector Gaussian channel with arbitrary signaling and pursues two closely related goals: i) closed-form expressions for the gradient of the mutual information with respect to arbitrary parameters of the system, and ii) fundamental connections between information theory and estimation theory. Generalizing the fundamental relationship recently unveiled by Guo, Shamai, and Verd{\'{u}}, we show that the gradient of the mutual information with respect to the channel matrix is equal to the product of the channel matrix and the error covariance matrix of the best estimate of the input given the output. Gradients and derivatives with respect to other parameters are then found via the differentiation chain rule.},

@article{Gauvain1994,
abstract = {In this paper, a framework for maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of hidden Markov models (HMM) is presented. Three key issues of MAP estimation, namely, the choice of prior distribution family, the specification of the parameters of prior densities, and the evaluation of the MAP estimates, are addressed. Using HMM's with Gaussian mixture state observation densities as an example, it is assumed that the prior densities for the HMM parameters can be adequately represented as a product of Dirichlet and normal-Wishart densities. The classical maximum likelihood estimation algorithms, namely, the forward-backward algorithm and the segmental k-means algorithm, are expanded, and MAP estimation formulas are developed. Prior density estimation issues are discussed for two classes of applications-parameter smoothing and model adaptation-and some experimental results are given illustrating the practical interest of this approach. Because of its adaptive nature, Bayesian learning is shown to serve as a unified approach for a wide range of speech recognition applications},
